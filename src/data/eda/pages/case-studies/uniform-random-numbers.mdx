## Background and Data

This case study applies exploratory data analysis to 500 observations drawn from a uniform distribution U(0,1), taken from a Rand Corporation publication. The purpose is to demonstrate how EDA graphical and quantitative techniques detect a non-normal underlying distribution while the remaining three assumptions -- fixed location, fixed variation, and randomness -- are all satisfied. This is the complementary case to the [normal random numbers](/eda/case-studies/normal-random-numbers/) study.

The dataset originates from NIST/SEMATECH Section 1.4.2.2. With n = 500 uniformly distributed observations, the distribution assumption is the only one that fails. This case study is critically important because it illustrates the effects of a known underlying non-normal distribution and validates whether EDA techniques correctly identify departure from normality when the true distribution is known in advance.

## Test Underlying Assumptions

### Goals

The analysis has three primary objectives:

1. **Model validation** -- assess whether the univariate model is an appropriate fit for the uniform random number data:

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="Y_i = C + E_i" />
</div>

2. **Assumption testing** -- evaluate whether the data satisfy the four standard assumptions for a measurement process in statistical control:
   - **Random sampling** -- the data are uncorrelated
   - **Fixed distribution** -- the data come from a fixed distribution
   - **Fixed location** -- the distribution location (mean) is constant
   - **Fixed variation** -- the distribution scale (standard deviation) is constant

3. **Confidence interval validity** -- determine whether the standard confidence interval formula is appropriate:

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="\bar{Y} \pm \frac{2s}{\sqrt{N}}" />
</div>

   where <InlineMath tex="s" /> is the standard deviation. This formula relies on all four assumptions holding; if the distributional assumption is violated, the confidence interval may not have the correct coverage probability.

If any assumptions are violated, identify the nature of the violations and recommend appropriate remedial actions.

## Graphical Output and Interpretation

### 4-Plot Overview

The [4-plot](/eda/techniques/4-plot/) immediately reveals one anomaly: while the run sequence plot and lag plot appear healthy, the histogram is rectangular rather than bell-shaped, and the normal probability plot shows strong S-shaped curvature. Three of four assumptions hold; the distributional assumption does not.

<UniformRandomPlots type="4-plot" />

The assumptions are addressed by the four diagnostic plots:

1. The **run sequence plot** (upper left) shows data fluctuating randomly in a stable band between 0 and 1 with no trend or shifts — the fixed-location and fixed-variation assumptions appear satisfied.
2. The **lag plot** (upper right) displays a structureless square cloud (the square shape, rather than circular, is characteristic of uniform data with bounded support) — the randomness assumption appears satisfied.
3. The **histogram** (lower left) is approximately flat (rectangular) across [0, 1] rather than bell-shaped — this is the clearest signal that the data are not normally distributed. The flat shape is the signature of a uniform distribution.
4. The **normal probability plot** (lower right) shows a pronounced S-shaped curve — the classic indicator of a light-tailed (platykurtic) distribution compared to the normal.

Three of four assumptions hold; the distributional assumption does not. The data are random, from a fixed location, with fixed variation, but the underlying distribution is uniform rather than normal.

### Run Sequence Plot

The [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) shows data fluctuating randomly in a stable band between 0 and 1. There is no trend, shift, or systematic pattern. Both location and variation remain constant across the run.

<UniformRandomPlots type="run-sequence" />

### Lag Plot

The [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/) at lag 1 displays a structureless square cloud, consistent with independent, identically distributed observations. The square shape (rather than circular) is characteristic of uniform data with bounded support.

<UniformRandomPlots type="lag" />

### Histogram

The [histogram](/eda/techniques/histogram/) is approximately flat (rectangular) across the interval [0, 1], which is the signature of a uniform distribution. There is no central peak, no bell shape, and no skewness. This is the clearest graphical signal that the data are not normally distributed.

<UniformRandomPlots type="histogram" />

### Normal Probability Plot

The [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/) shows a pronounced S-shaped curve rather than the expected straight line. The tails curve away from the theoretical line in opposite directions -- the lower tail curves upward and the upper tail curves downward. This S-shape is the classic indicator of a light-tailed (platykurtic) distribution compared to the normal.

<UniformRandomPlots type="normal-probability" />

### Uniform Probability Plot

The [uniform probability plot](/eda/techniques/probability-plot/) provides the definitive distributional test for these data. When the data truly follow a uniform distribution, the plot should be nearly linear.

<UniformRandomPlots type="uniform-probability" />

The nearly linear pattern confirms that the uniform distribution is an excellent model for these data, contrasting sharply with the S-shaped curvature in the normal probability plot above.

### Autocorrelation Plot

The [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) confirms the randomness assumption. All autocorrelation coefficients at lags 1 through 50 fall within the 95% confidence bands at ±2/√N, consistent with independent observations.

<UniformRandomPlots type="autocorrelation" />

### Spectral Plot

The [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) shows a flat power spectrum with no dominant peaks, consistent with white noise. This confirms that the data have no periodic structure or frequency-domain dependence.

<UniformRandomPlots type="spectral" />

## Quantitative Output and Interpretation

### Summary Statistics

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sample size <InlineMath tex="n" /> | 500 |
| Mean <InlineMath tex="\bar{Y}" /> | 0.5078 |
| Std Dev <InlineMath tex="s" /> | 0.2943 |
| Median | 0.5184 |
| Min | 0.0025 |
| Max | 0.9971 |
| Range | 0.9946 |

The sample mean of 0.5078 is close to the theoretical value of 0.5, and the sample standard deviation of 0.2943 approximates the theoretical value of <InlineMath tex="1/\sqrt{12} = 0.2887" />.

### Location Test

The location test fits a linear regression of the response <InlineMath tex="Y" /> against the run-order index <InlineMath tex="X = 1, 2, \ldots, N" /> and tests whether the slope is significantly different from zero.

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="H_0\!: B_1 = 0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a\!: B_1 \neq 0" />
</div>

| Parameter | Estimate | Std Error | t-Value |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| <InlineMath tex="B_0" /> (intercept) | 0.522923 | 0.02638 | 19.82 |
| <InlineMath tex="B_1" /> (slope) | <InlineMath tex="-6.025 \times 10^{-5}" /> | <InlineMath tex="9.125 \times 10^{-5}" /> | −0.66 |

Residual standard deviation: 0.2945 with 498 degrees of freedom.

**Conclusion:** The slope t-value of −0.66 does not exceed the critical value <InlineMath tex="t_{0.975,\,498} = 1.96" />, so we **fail to reject** <InlineMath tex="H_0" /> — the slope is not significantly different from zero at the 5% significance level. The process mean is stable at approximately 0.508. The **fixed-location assumption is satisfied**.

### Variation Test

The [Levene test](/eda/quantitative/levene-test/) is used instead of Bartlett's test because the data are non-normal (uniform). The Levene test (median-based variant) divides the data into <InlineMath tex="k = 4" /> equal-length intervals and tests whether their variances are homogeneous.

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="H_0\!: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = \sigma_3^2 = \sigma_4^2 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a\!: \text{at least one } \sigma_i^2 \text{ differs}" />
</div>

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Test statistic <InlineMath tex="W" /> | 0.07983 |
| Degrees of freedom | <InlineMath tex="k - 1 = 3" /> and <InlineMath tex="N - k = 496" /> |
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="F_{0.05,\,3,\,496}" /> | 2.623 |

**Conclusion:** The test statistic of 0.07983 is well below the critical value of 2.623, so we **fail to reject** <InlineMath tex="H_0" /> — the variances are not significantly different across the four intervals. The **fixed-variation assumption is satisfied**.

### Randomness Tests

Two complementary tests assess whether the observations are independent.

**Runs test** -- tests whether the sequence of values above and below the median was produced randomly.

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="H_0\!: \text{sequence is random} \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a\!: \text{sequence is not random}" />
</div>

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Test statistic <InlineMath tex="Z" /> | 0.2686 |
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="Z_{1-\alpha/2}" /> | 1.96 |

**Conclusion:** <InlineMath tex="|Z| = 0.269" /> does not exceed 1.96, so we **fail to reject** <InlineMath tex="H_0" /> — the sequence is consistent with randomness.

**Lag-1 autocorrelation** -- measures the linear dependence between consecutive observations.

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| <InlineMath tex="r_1" /> | 0.03 |
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="2/\sqrt{N}" /> | 0.087 |

**Conclusion:** The lag-1 autocorrelation of 0.03 is well within the critical bounds of <InlineMath tex="\pm 0.087" />, and values at all lags through lag 50 fall within the significance bounds. The data are independent. The **randomness assumption is satisfied**.

### Distribution Test

The [Anderson-Darling test](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) and [PPCC test](/eda/techniques/ppcc-plot/) are applied to test whether the data follow a normal distribution.

**Normal distribution tests:**

| Test | Statistic | Critical Value | Result |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Anderson-Darling <InlineMath tex="A^2" /> | 5.765 | 0.787 | **Reject normality** |
| Normal PPCC | 0.9772 | 0.987 | **Reject normality** |

The Anderson-Darling statistic of 5.765 far exceeds the 5% critical value of 0.787, and the normal PPCC of 0.9772 is less than its critical value of 0.987. Both tests decisively reject the null hypothesis of normality.

**Uniform distribution tests:**

| Test | Statistic | Result |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Uniform PPCC | 0.9996 | **Excellent fit** |
| Uniform Anderson-Darling <InlineMath tex="A^2" /> | 0.9082 | **Good fit** |

The uniform PPCC of 0.9996 indicates an excellent fit to the uniform distribution. The [skewness and kurtosis](/eda/quantitative/skewness-kurtosis/) values are approximately 0.00 and approximately −1.20, respectively — close to the theoretical uniform values of 0.0 and −1.2. The negative excess kurtosis confirms a platykurtic (flat-topped) distribution relative to the normal.

**Conclusion:** The data are **not normally distributed** but are **an excellent fit to the uniform distribution**.

### Outlier Detection

[Grubbs' test](/eda/quantitative/grubbs-test/) does not identify outliers, which is expected since the uniform distribution has finite support and the observations are well-contained within [0, 1].

### Test Summary

| Assumption | Test | Statistic | Critical Value | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fixed location** | Regression on run order | <InlineMath tex="t = {-0.66}" /> | 1.96 | **Fail to reject** |
| **Fixed variation** | [Levene test](/eda/quantitative/levene-test/) | <InlineMath tex="W = 0.080" /> | 2.623 | **Fail to reject** |
| **Randomness** | [Runs test](/eda/quantitative/runs-test/) | <InlineMath tex="Z = 0.269" /> | 1.96 | **Fail to reject** |
| **Randomness** | [Autocorrelation](/eda/quantitative/autocorrelation/) lag-1 | <InlineMath tex="r_1 = 0.03" /> | 0.087 | **Fail to reject** |
| **Distribution** | [Anderson-Darling](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) (normal) | <InlineMath tex="A^2 = 5.765" /> | 0.787 | **Reject** |
| **Distribution** | [PPCC](/eda/techniques/ppcc-plot/) (normal) | 0.9772 | 0.987 | **Reject** |
| **Outliers** | [Grubbs' test](/eda/quantitative/grubbs-test/) | — | — | No outliers |

Three of four assumptions hold. The distributional assumption fails — the data follow a uniform, not normal, distribution. The univariate model <InlineMath tex="Y_i = C + E_i" /> is appropriate, but the error term <InlineMath tex="E_i" /> follows a uniform rather than normal distribution.

## Conclusions

Three of four assumptions hold: fixed location, fixed variation, and randomness are confirmed. The distributional assumption fails — the data follow a uniform, not normal, distribution.

This has practical implications for inference. The sample mean remains a valid location estimate, but confidence intervals based on the normal distribution will be incorrect. The standard confidence interval:

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="\bar{Y} \pm \frac{2s}{\sqrt{N}} = 0.508 \pm 0.026" />
</div>

is approximately valid by the central limit theorem (with <InlineMath tex="n = 500" /> the CLT provides reasonable coverage), yielding a 95% interval of (0.482, 0.534). However, for uniform data the mid-range is the optimal location estimator, with a tighter 95% bootstrap confidence interval of approximately (0.497, 0.503).

A distribution-free confidence interval or bootstrap approach should be preferred when the normality assumption is known to be violated. This case study demonstrates that EDA techniques — particularly the histogram, normal probability plot, Anderson-Darling test, and PPCC — reliably detect non-normal distributions, even when all other assumptions are satisfied.
