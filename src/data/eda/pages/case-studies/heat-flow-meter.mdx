## Background and Data

This case study applies exploratory data analysis to the NIST ZARR13.DAT dataset, which contains 195 calibration factor measurements from a heat flow meter calibration and stability analysis. The data were collected by Bob Zarr of NIST in January 1990. The response variable is a calibration factor, and the motivation for studying this dataset is to illustrate a well-behaved process where the underlying assumptions hold and the process is in statistical control.

The dataset originates from NIST/SEMATECH Section 1.4.2.8. With <InlineMath tex="n = 195" /> observations, this study demonstrates how the standard EDA methodology confirms that a univariate measurement process meets the assumptions required for valid statistical inference.

## Test Underlying Assumptions

### Goals

The analysis has three primary objectives:

1. **Model validation** — assess whether the univariate model is an appropriate fit for the heat flow meter calibration data:

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="Y_i = C + E_i" />
</div>

2. **Assumption testing** — evaluate whether the data satisfy the four standard assumptions for a measurement process in statistical control:
   - **Random sampling** — the data are uncorrelated
   - **Fixed distribution** — the data come from a fixed distribution
   - **Fixed location** — the distribution location (mean) is constant
   - **Fixed variation** — the distribution scale (standard deviation) is constant

3. **Confidence interval validity** — determine whether the standard confidence interval formula is appropriate:

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="\bar{Y} \pm \frac{2s}{\sqrt{N}}" />
</div>

   where <InlineMath tex="s" /> is the standard deviation. This formula relies on all four assumptions holding; if they are violated, the confidence interval has no statistical meaning.

## Graphical Output and Interpretation

### 4-Plot Overview

The [4-plot](/eda/techniques/4-plot/) is the primary graphical tool for testing all four assumptions simultaneously. For the heat flow meter data, it reveals a well-behaved dataset. The run sequence plot indicates no significant shifts in location or scale over time. The lag plot does not indicate any non-random pattern. The histogram shows the data are reasonably symmetric and consistent with a normal distribution. The normal probability plot verifies that the normality assumption is reasonable.

<HeatFlowMeterPlots type="4-plot" />

The assumptions are addressed by the four diagnostic plots:

1. The **run sequence plot** (upper left) shows 195 measurements fluctuating around a stable central value of approximately 9.261 with no systematic drift — the fixed-location and fixed-variation assumptions appear satisfied.
2. The **lag plot** (upper right) displays a roughly circular scatter cloud, consistent with approximately independent observations — no strong evidence of non-randomness.
3. The **histogram** (lower left) is approximately symmetric and bell-shaped, centered near 9.261 — consistent with a normal distribution.
4. The **normal probability plot** (lower right) shows data points closely following the theoretical straight line — confirming that the normality assumption is reasonable.

From the above plots, we conclude that the underlying assumptions are valid and the data follow approximately a normal distribution. The standard confidence interval is appropriate for quantifying the uncertainty of the calibration factor.

### Run Sequence Plot

The [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) shows 195 measurements fluctuating around a stable central value of approximately 9.261. No systematic drift or trend is visible. The data are consistent with a stable measurement process.

<HeatFlowMeterPlots type="run-sequence" />

### Lag Plot

The [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/) at lag 1 displays a roughly circular scatter cloud, consistent with approximately independent observations. There is no strong linear or curvilinear pattern that would indicate severe autocorrelation.

<HeatFlowMeterPlots type="lag" />

### Histogram

The [histogram](/eda/techniques/histogram/) is approximately symmetric and bell-shaped, centered near 9.261. The shape is consistent with a normal distribution. An overlaid normal PDF with mean 9.261 and standard deviation 0.023 fits the data well.

<HeatFlowMeterPlots type="histogram" />

### Normal Probability Plot

The [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/) shows data points closely following the theoretical straight line (fitted intercept 9.261, slope 0.023). The linearity confirms that the normality assumption is reasonable for these data.

<HeatFlowMeterPlots type="probability" />

### Autocorrelation Plot

The [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) quantifies the serial dependence in the data. With 95% confidence bands at <InlineMath tex="\pm 2/\sqrt{195} = \pm 0.143" />, autocorrelation coefficients exceeding these bounds indicate significant non-randomness.

<HeatFlowMeterPlots type="autocorrelation" />

The lag-1 autocorrelation of 0.281 exceeds the significance bounds, confirming the mild non-randomness detected by the runs test. However, the autocorrelation decays quickly, and the departure from independence is not severe enough to warrant a more complex model.

### Spectral Plot

The [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) shows the frequency-domain structure of the calibration data.

<HeatFlowMeterPlots type="spectral" />

The spectrum shows modest low-frequency content consistent with the mild autocorrelation, but no sharp peaks that would indicate periodic structure. The process is essentially well-behaved with a minor departure from strict independence.

## Quantitative Output and Interpretation

### Summary Statistics

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sample size <InlineMath tex="n" /> | 195 |
| Mean <InlineMath tex="\bar{Y}" /> | 9.261460 |
| Std Dev <InlineMath tex="s" /> | 0.022789 |
| Median | 9.261952 |
| Min | 9.196848 |
| Max | 9.327973 |
| Range | 0.131126 |

The mean and median are nearly identical (9.261460 vs. 9.261952), confirming symmetry. The standard deviation of 0.023 represents approximately 0.25% relative precision, typical for heat flow meter calibrations.

### Location Test

The location test fits a linear regression of the response <InlineMath tex="Y" /> against the run-order index <InlineMath tex="X = 1, 2, \ldots, N" /> and tests whether the slope is significantly different from zero.

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="H_0\!: B_1 = 0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a\!: B_1 \neq 0" />
</div>

| Parameter | Estimate | Std Error | t-Value |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| <InlineMath tex="B_0" /> (intercept) | 9.26699 | 0.003253 | 2849 |
| <InlineMath tex="B_1" /> (slope) | −0.000056412 | 0.00002878 | −1.960 |

Residual standard deviation: 0.022624 with 193 degrees of freedom.

**Conclusion:** The slope t-value of −1.960 is at the boundary of the critical value <InlineMath tex="t_{0.975,\,193} = 1.96" />. While technically borderline, the slope estimate of −0.000056 is so small that it can essentially be considered zero — the estimated drift over the entire 195-observation run is only <InlineMath tex="195 \times 0.000056 = 0.011" />, less than half a standard deviation. The **fixed-location assumption is satisfied**.

### Variation Test

[Bartlett's test](/eda/quantitative/bartletts-test/) divides the data into <InlineMath tex="k = 4" /> equal-length intervals and tests whether their variances are homogeneous.

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="H_0\!: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = \sigma_3^2 = \sigma_4^2 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a\!: \text{at least one } \sigma_i^2 \text{ differs}" />
</div>

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Test statistic <InlineMath tex="T" /> | 3.147 |
| Degrees of freedom | <InlineMath tex="k - 1 = 3" /> |
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="\chi^2_{0.05,\,3}" /> | 7.815 |
| Significance level <InlineMath tex="\alpha" /> | 0.05 |

**Conclusion:** The test statistic of 3.147 is well below the critical value of 7.815, so we **do not reject** <InlineMath tex="H_0" /> — the variances are not significantly different across the four quarters of the dataset. The **constant-variation assumption is satisfied**.

### Randomness Tests

Two complementary tests assess whether the observations are independent.

**Runs test** — tests whether the sequence of values above and below the median was produced randomly.

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="H_0\!: \text{sequence is random} \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a\!: \text{sequence is not random}" />
</div>

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Test statistic <InlineMath tex="Z" /> | −3.2306 |
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="Z_{1-\alpha/2}" /> | 1.96 |

**Conclusion:** <InlineMath tex="|Z| = 3.23" /> exceeds 1.96, so we **reject** <InlineMath tex="H_0" /> — the data show statistically significant non-randomness. The negative Z indicates fewer runs than expected, meaning the data tend to cluster in sequences above or below the median.

**Lag-1 autocorrelation** — measures the linear dependence between consecutive observations.

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| <InlineMath tex="r_1" /> | 0.281 |
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="1.96/\sqrt{N}" /> | 0.140 |

**Conclusion:** The lag-1 autocorrelation of 0.281 exceeds the critical value of 0.140, confirming the non-randomness detected by the runs test. The **randomness assumption is violated**, but the violation is mild — the autocorrelation is modest compared to cases like a [random walk](/eda/case-studies/random-walk/) where <InlineMath tex="r_1 \approx 0.99" />.

However, as the NIST handbook notes, the violation of the randomness assumption is mild and "not serious enough to warrant developing a more sophisticated model." In practice, mild non-randomness is common in calibration data and requires a judgment call about whether the violation warrants a more complex model.

### Distribution Test

The probability plot correlation coefficient is 0.999, exceeding the critical value of 0.987. The [Anderson-Darling test](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) provides a more sensitive formal test.

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| PPCC | 0.999 |
| PPCC critical value | 0.987 |
| Anderson-Darling <InlineMath tex="A^2" /> | 0.129 |
| Critical value (<InlineMath tex="\alpha = 0.05" />) | 0.787 |

**Conclusion:** Both the PPCC (0.999 > 0.987) and Anderson-Darling (<InlineMath tex="A^2 = 0.129" /> well below 0.787) support the normality assumption. The **normal distribution is a good model** for this data.

### Outlier Detection

[Grubbs' test](/eda/quantitative/grubbs-test/) tests whether the most extreme observation is a statistical outlier.

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| <InlineMath tex="G" /> | 2.918673 |
| Critical value (upper one-tailed, <InlineMath tex="\alpha = 0.05" />) | 3.597898 |

**Conclusion:** <InlineMath tex="G = 2.919" /> is less than the critical value of 3.598, so we **do not reject** the null hypothesis — **no outliers are detected**.

### Test Summary

| Assumption | Test | Statistic | Critical Value | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fixed location** | Regression on run order | <InlineMath tex="t = {-1.960}" /> | 1.96 | **Borderline — do not reject** |
| **Fixed variation** | [Bartlett's test](/eda/quantitative/bartletts-test/) | <InlineMath tex="T = 3.147" /> | 7.815 | **Do not reject** |
| **Randomness** | [Runs test](/eda/quantitative/runs-test/) | <InlineMath tex="Z = {-3.231}" /> | 1.96 | **Reject** |
| **Randomness** | [Autocorrelation](/eda/quantitative/autocorrelation/) lag-1 | <InlineMath tex="r_1 = 0.281" /> | 0.140 | **Reject** |
| **Normality** | [Anderson-Darling](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) | <InlineMath tex="A^2 = 0.129" /> | 0.787 | **Do not reject** |
| **Outliers** | [Grubbs' test](/eda/quantitative/grubbs-test/) | <InlineMath tex="G = 2.919" /> | 3.598 | **Do not reject** |

The assumptions of fixed location, fixed variation, and normality are satisfied. The randomness assumption shows a mild violation (lag-1 autocorrelation of 0.281 is statistically significant), but the departure is not severe enough to require a more complex model.

## Interpretation

The graphical and quantitative analyses are largely consistent: three of the four underlying assumptions are clearly satisfied, and the sole violation is mild. The [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) shows a stable process with no visible trend, confirmed by the borderline location test (<InlineMath tex="t = -1.960" />, with estimated drift of only 0.011 over the full run -- less than half a standard deviation). [Bartlett's test](/eda/quantitative/bartletts-test/) confirms constant variation (<InlineMath tex="T = 3.147" />, well below the critical value of 7.815). The [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/) is closely linear, and both the [Anderson-Darling test](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) (<InlineMath tex="A^2 = 0.129" />, well below 0.787) and PPCC (0.999, well above 0.987) strongly support normality. [Grubbs' test](/eda/quantitative/grubbs-test/) (<InlineMath tex="G = 2.919" />, below 3.598) confirms no outliers.

The only departure from the ideal is a mild violation of the randomness assumption. The [runs test](/eda/quantitative/runs-test/) (<InlineMath tex="Z = -3.231" />) and lag-1 [autocorrelation](/eda/quantitative/autocorrelation/) (<InlineMath tex="r_1 = 0.281" />) both reject independence at the 5% level. However, the [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) shows that the dependence decays quickly beyond lag 1, and the [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) reveals no periodic structure -- the modest low-frequency content is consistent with mild short-range correlation rather than a systematic pattern. As the NIST handbook notes, the departure "is not serious enough to warrant developing a more sophisticated model."

The univariate model <InlineMath tex="Y_i = 9.26146 + E_i" /> is appropriate for this dataset. The standard 95% [confidence interval](/eda/quantitative/confidence-limits/) is approximately valid, though the true uncertainty is somewhat larger than <InlineMath tex="\bar{Y} \pm 2s/\sqrt{N}" /> suggests due to the mild autocorrelation. The process is considered to be in statistical control -- the calibration factor is stable, the variation is consistent, and the data are well-described by a [normal distribution](/eda/distributions/normal/).

## Conclusions

The heat flow meter calibration data satisfy three of the four assumptions. The location is stable, the variation is constant across quarters of the dataset, and the data follow a normal distribution with no outliers. The randomness assumption shows a mild violation — the lag-1 autocorrelation of 0.281 and runs test statistic of −3.23 both reject the null hypothesis of independence at the 5% level. However, this violation is not severe enough to invalidate the univariate model.

The recommended model is:

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="Y_i = 9.26146 + E_i" />
</div>

The 95% confidence interval for the calibration factor is:

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="\bar{Y} \pm \frac{2s}{\sqrt{N}} = 9.26146 \pm 2 \times \frac{0.02279}{\sqrt{195}} = (9.2582,\; 9.2647)" />
</div>

The standard deviation of the mean is <InlineMath tex="s/\sqrt{N} = 0.001632" />, and the 95% confidence interval for the standard deviation is (0.02073, 0.02531).

Because the randomness assumption has a mild violation, the true uncertainty is somewhat larger than the standard confidence interval suggests. Nevertheless, the NIST handbook considers this process to be **in statistical control** — the departure from randomness is not serious enough to warrant developing a more sophisticated model. This case study illustrates a well-behaved measurement process where the standard EDA methodology confirms that simple statistical inference based on the sample mean is appropriate.
