## Background and Data

This case study applies exploratory data analysis to 101 measurements of fatigue life (thousands of cycles until rupture) of rectangular strips of 6061-T6 aluminum sheeting, subjected to periodic loading with maximum stress of 21,000 psi, as reported by Birnbaum and Saunders (1958). The dataset is referred to as BIRNSAUN.DAT in the NIST archive.

The dataset originates from NIST/SEMATECH Section 1.4.2.9. Unlike the other case studies in this collection, the fatigue life study focuses specifically on probabilistic model selection: determining which probability distribution best describes the dispersion of measured lifetimes for reliability prediction and warranty estimation.

## Test Underlying Assumptions

### Goals

The goals of this analysis are:

1. Determine if the fatigue life data can be adequately modeled with a known probability distribution for reliability prediction
2. Assess the fixed-location assumption: is the process mean stable over the run?
3. Assess the fixed-variation assumption: is the process variability constant?
4. Assess the randomness assumption: are the observations independent?
5. Determine which probability distribution (Normal, Gamma, Weibull, or Birnbaum-Saunders) best describes the fatigue life dispersion

## Graphical Output and Interpretation

### 4-Plot Overview

The [4-plot](/eda/techniques/4-plot/) provides a comprehensive view of the fatigue life data. The run sequence plot should show stable location and variation, the lag plot should show no dependence, and the histogram reveals the right-skewed distribution.

<FatigueLifePlots type="4-plot" />

The assumptions are addressed by the four diagnostic plots:

1. The **run sequence plot** (upper left) shows 101 observations fluctuating around a stable mean with no systematic drift or shifts — the fixed-location and fixed-variation assumptions appear satisfied.
2. The **lag plot** (upper right) shows a structureless scatter cloud, consistent with independent observations — the randomness assumption appears satisfied.
3. The **histogram** (lower left) is right-skewed, with most observations clustering between 800 and 1,600 thousand cycles and a long upper tail extending past 2,000 — the distribution is not symmetric and not bell-shaped.
4. The **normal probability plot** (lower right) shows deviations from the theoretical straight line, particularly in the tails — the normality assumption is questionable.

Three of four assumptions hold: fixed location, fixed variation, and randomness. The distributional assumption requires further investigation — the right-skewed shape suggests that alternative distributions (Gamma, Weibull, Birnbaum-Saunders) may provide a better fit than the normal.

### Box Plot

The initial graphical analysis uses dot charts, [box plots](/eda/techniques/box-plot/), [histograms](/eda/techniques/histogram/), and kernel density estimates to characterize the distribution. The [box plot](/eda/techniques/box-plot/) suggests the largest measured value may be an outlier.

<FatigueLifePlots type="box-plot" />

### Run Sequence Plot

The [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) shows 101 observations fluctuating around the mean of approximately 1401 thousand cycles. The location and variation appear stable across the run, with no systematic drift or shifts.

<FatigueLifePlots type="run-sequence" />

### Lag Plot

The [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/) at lag 1 shows a structureless scatter cloud, consistent with independent observations. The slight elongation in the scatter reflects the skewed distribution rather than serial dependence.

<FatigueLifePlots type="lag" />

### Histogram

The data range from slightly above 350 to slightly below 2,500 thousand cycles. The [histogram](/eda/techniques/histogram/) is right-skewed, with most observations clustering between 800 and 1,600 thousand cycles and a long upper tail extending past 2,000.

<FatigueLifePlots type="histogram" />

### Normal Probability Plot

The [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/) (Q-Q plot) shows the data deviating from the theoretical straight line, particularly in the tails. When compared against an envelope of 99 simulated Gaussian samples of the same size, the data Q-Q plot falls within the envelope, suggesting the Gaussian model cannot be firmly rejected on graphical grounds alone.

<FatigueLifePlots type="normal-probability" />

### Autocorrelation Plot

The [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) confirms that the fatigue life measurements are independent. All autocorrelation coefficients fall within the 95% confidence bands.

<FatigueLifePlots type="autocorrelation" />

### Spectral Plot

The [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) shows a flat spectrum with no dominant peaks, consistent with independent observations.

<FatigueLifePlots type="spectral" />

### Distribution Comparison

#### Weibull Probability Plot

The [Weibull probability plot](/eda/techniques/probability-plot/) tests the fit of the 3-parameter Weibull model (location=181, shape=3.43, scale=1357) by subtracting the location parameter from the data before plotting. If the shifted data follow a 2-parameter Weibull distribution, the points should fall near a straight line.

<FatigueLifePlots type="weibull-probability" />

The points follow the reference line reasonably well, with some deviation in the upper tail. The Weibull model captures the general shape of the distribution but the AIC/BIC analysis (below) shows it does not outperform the simpler Gaussian model for this dataset.

#### Gamma Probability Plot

The [gamma probability plot](/eda/techniques/probability-plot/) compares sorted data values against theoretical quantiles from a Gamma distribution with shape <InlineMath tex="\alpha = 11.85" /> and scale <InlineMath tex="\beta = 118.2" /> (NIST MLE estimates, rate parameterization converted: <InlineMath tex="\beta = 1/0.00846" />).

<FatigueLifePlots type="gamma-probability" />

The gamma probability plot shows a good fit with points closely following the reference line across the full range of the data. The gamma distribution provides a reasonable model for this right-skewed dataset, though the formal AIC/BIC comparison determines whether it outperforms the Gaussian model.

Four candidate distributions are compared by overlaying their fitted probability densities on a non-parametric kernel density estimate of the data:

- **Normal (Gaussian)**: mean 1401, standard deviation 389
- **Gamma**: shape 11.85, rate 0.00846
- **Birnbaum-Saunders**: shape 0.310, scale 1337
- **3-parameter Weibull**: location 181, shape 3.43, scale 1357

All four fitted densities approximate the non-parametric estimate reasonably well, though the comparison is limited by the sample size of 101.

## Quantitative Output and Interpretation

### Summary Statistics

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mean | 1401 |
| Std Dev | 389 |
| Median | 1340 |
| Min | 370 |
| Max | 2440 |
| Range | 2070 |
| n | 101 |

The mean exceeds the median, consistent with the right-skewed shape visible in the histogram. All values are positive, representing thousands of cycles to failure for the aluminum coupons.

### Location Test

The location test fits a linear regression of the response <InlineMath tex="Y" /> against the run-order index <InlineMath tex="X = 1, 2, \ldots, N" /> and tests whether the slope is significantly different from zero.

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="H_0\!: B_1 = 0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a\!: B_1 \neq 0" />
</div>

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Test statistic <InlineMath tex="t" /> | 2.5628 |
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="t_{0.975,\,99}" /> | 1.984 |
| Significance level <InlineMath tex="\alpha" /> | 0.05 |

**Conclusion:** The test statistic <InlineMath tex="t = 2.563" /> slightly exceeds the critical value of 1.984, formally rejecting the null hypothesis of constant location. However, the run sequence plot shows no visually apparent trend or shift. The marginal rejection likely reflects the influence of a few extreme values in the right tail on the regression slope rather than a genuine systematic drift. Given the primary focus on distribution fitting rather than process monitoring, the location is treated as approximately fixed for practical purposes.

### Variation Test

[Bartlett's test](/eda/quantitative/bartletts-test/) divides the data into <InlineMath tex="k = 4" /> equal-length intervals and tests whether their variances are homogeneous.

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="H_0\!: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = \sigma_3^2 = \sigma_4^2 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a\!: \text{at least one } \sigma_i^2 \text{ differs}" />
</div>

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Test statistic <InlineMath tex="T" /> | 0.9490 |
| Degrees of freedom | <InlineMath tex="k - 1 = 3" /> |
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="\chi^2_{0.95,\,3}" /> | 7.775 |

**Conclusion:** The test statistic of 0.949 is well below the critical value of 7.775, so we **fail to reject** <InlineMath tex="H_0" /> — the variances are not significantly different across the four quarters. The **constant-variation assumption is satisfied**.

### Randomness Tests

Two complementary tests assess whether the observations are independent.

**Runs test** — tests whether the sequence of values above and below the median was produced randomly.

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="H_0\!: \text{sequence is random} \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a\!: \text{sequence is not random}" />
</div>

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Test statistic <InlineMath tex="Z" /> | -3.4995 |
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="Z_{1-\alpha/2}" /> | 1.96 |

**Conclusion:** <InlineMath tex="|Z| = 3.50" /> exceeds 1.96, so the runs test **rejects** <InlineMath tex="H_0" />. The negative Z indicates fewer runs than expected, suggesting some clustering of values above and below the median.

**Lag-1 autocorrelation** — measures the linear dependence between consecutive observations.

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| <InlineMath tex="r_1" /> | 0.108 |
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="2/\sqrt{N}" /> | 0.199 |

**Conclusion:** The lag-1 autocorrelation of 0.108 is within the critical bounds of <InlineMath tex="\pm 0.199" />, and the [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) confirms all coefficients fall within the 95% confidence bands. The runs test rejection with non-significant lag-1 autocorrelation suggests the clustering is mild — driven by the skewed distribution rather than genuine temporal dependence. The **randomness assumption is approximately satisfied** given the consistent graphical evidence.

### Distribution Tests

The probability plot correlation coefficient (PPCC) and [Anderson-Darling test](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) assess whether the data follow a normal distribution.

| Test | Statistic | Critical Value | Result |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| PPCC (normal) | 0.997 | 0.987 | Fail to reject |
| [Anderson-Darling](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) | <InlineMath tex="A^2 = 0.2068" /> | 0.787 | Fail to reject |

**Conclusion:** Both tests fail to reject normality. The PPCC of 0.997 exceeds the critical value of 0.987, and the Anderson-Darling statistic of <InlineMath tex="A^2 = 0.207" /> is well below the critical value of 0.787. Despite the visual right-skewness in the histogram, the formal tests do not reject the Gaussian model at the 5% level. This result is consistent with the AIC/BIC model comparison below, which also favors the Gaussian.

### Outlier Detection

[Grubbs' test](/eda/quantitative/grubbs-test/) tests whether the most extreme observation is a statistical outlier.

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Test statistic <InlineMath tex="G" /> | 2.6553 |
| Critical value (<InlineMath tex="n = 101" />, <InlineMath tex="\alpha = 0.05" />) | 3.388 |

**Conclusion:** <InlineMath tex="G = 2.655" /> is below the critical value of 3.388, so we **fail to reject** — **no significant outliers are detected** at the 5% level. The extreme value of 2,440 thousand cycles, flagged as a potential outlier in the box plot, does not reach statistical significance.

### Test Summary

| Assumption | Test | Statistic | Critical Value | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fixed location** | Regression on run order | <InlineMath tex="t = 2.563" /> | 1.984 | **Marginal reject** |
| **Fixed variation** | [Bartlett's test](/eda/quantitative/bartletts-test/) | <InlineMath tex="T = 0.949" /> | 7.775 | **Fail to reject** |
| **Randomness** | [Runs test](/eda/quantitative/runs-test/) | <InlineMath tex="Z = {-3.500}" /> | 1.96 | **Reject** |
| **Randomness** | [Autocorrelation](/eda/quantitative/autocorrelation/) lag-1 | <InlineMath tex="r_1 = 0.108" /> | 0.199 | **Fail to reject** |
| **Normality** | [Anderson-Darling](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) | <InlineMath tex="A^2 = 0.207" /> | 0.787 | **Fail to reject** |
| **Normality** | PPCC | <InlineMath tex="r = 0.997" /> | 0.987 | **Fail to reject** |
| **Outliers** | [Grubbs' test](/eda/quantitative/grubbs-test/) | <InlineMath tex="G = 2.655" /> | 3.388 | **Fail to reject** |

The variation, normality, and outlier assumptions are clearly satisfied. The location test marginally rejects and the runs test rejects, though the lag-1 autocorrelation does not. The graphical evidence from the run sequence and autocorrelation plots supports approximate stability and independence. As this case study focuses primarily on distribution identification rather than process control, the distributional assumption — supported by both the Anderson-Darling and PPCC tests — is the central quantitative finding and motivates the AIC/BIC model comparison below.

### Model Selection

Model comparison using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) yields:

| Model | AIC | BIC |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Gaussian | 1495 | 1501 |
| Weibull (3-param) | 1498 | 1505 |
| Gamma | 1499 | 1504 |
| Birnbaum-Saunders | 1507 | 1512 |

The Gaussian model has the lowest AIC and BIC. Converting to posterior probabilities (assuming equal prior probabilities), the Gaussian model has 76% probability, Gamma 16%, Weibull 7.4%, and Birnbaum-Saunders 0.27%.

### Prediction Intervals

Using the selected Gaussian model, the 0.1st percentile of the fitted distribution (the value exceeded with probability 99.9%) is approximately 198 thousand cycles. Bootstrap analysis based on 5,000 resamples yields a 95% confidence interval for this percentile ranging from 40 to 366 thousand cycles, reflecting the substantial uncertainty inherent in estimating extreme percentiles from 101 observations.

## Conclusions

Despite the visual right-skewness in the histogram, formal model comparison via AIC and BIC favors the Gaussian distribution over the Gamma, Birnbaum-Saunders, and 3-parameter [Weibull](/eda/distributions/weibull/) alternatives for this specific dataset. The key lesson is that visual impressions of non-normality should be confirmed by quantitative model selection criteria before choosing an alternative distribution. For reliability applications, the lower percentiles of the fitted distribution are most relevant (B1, B10 life estimates), and the wide bootstrap confidence intervals emphasize the uncertainty in extreme-tail estimation from moderate sample sizes. This case study demonstrates the value of comparing multiple candidate models rather than assuming a particular distributional form based solely on the application domain.
