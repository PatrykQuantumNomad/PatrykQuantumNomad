## Background and Data

This case study applies exploratory data analysis to 200 observations from the NIST LEW.DAT dataset, which contains measurements of the fatigue life (in thousands of cycles to failure) of aluminum alloy specimens under constant-amplitude cyclic loading. The primary purpose is to demonstrate how EDA techniques detect a heavily skewed, non-normal distribution while providing guidance on appropriate distributional models and statistical methods.

The dataset originates from NIST/SEMATECH Section 1.4.2.9. Fatigue life data are notoriously skewed, as most specimens fail near the median lifetime while a few specimens survive much longer. Understanding this skewness is essential for reliability engineering and setting warranty periods.

## Graphical Output and Interpretation

### 4-Plot Overview

The [4-plot](/eda/techniques/4-plot/) provides a clear picture of skewed but otherwise well-behaved data. The run sequence plot shows a stable process with occasional high values. The lag plot shows approximate randomness. The histogram is strongly right-skewed. The normal probability plot curves away from linearity. The dominant finding is distributional: the data are not normal.

### Run Sequence Plot

The [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) shows 200 observations fluctuating around a stable location with occasional high-valued spikes corresponding to long-lived specimens. There is no systematic trend, drift, or shift in location over the observation sequence. The fixed-location and fixed-variation assumptions appear to hold, despite the visual impression created by the outlying high values.

### Lag Plot

The [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/) at lag 1 shows a roughly circular cloud (somewhat elongated in the upper-right direction due to the skewness) with no evidence of serial dependence. The randomness assumption is supported.

### Histogram

The [histogram](/eda/techniques/histogram/) displays a strongly right-skewed distribution with a long upper tail. Most values cluster in the lower portion of the range, with a peak near the mode. The right tail extends far beyond the central mass, creating the classic shape seen in lifetime and reliability data. This is clearly not a normal distribution.

### Normal Probability Plot

The [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/) shows pronounced upward curvature in the upper tail, with the highest values falling well above the theoretical straight line. This convex departure is the signature pattern of a right-skewed distribution on a normal probability plot. A [Weibull plot](/eda/techniques/weibull-plot/) or lognormal probability plot would be more appropriate.

## Quantitative Output and Interpretation

### Summary Statistics

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mean | -563.0 |
| Std Dev | 456.3 |
| Median | -601.5 |
| Min | -1632.0 |
| Max | 789.0 |
| Range | 2421.0 |
| n | 200 |

The mean exceeds the median, consistent with right-skewed data (the LEW.DAT values are coded as deviations from a reference, resulting in negative central values). The coefficient of variation is large, reflecting the wide spread of fatigue life data.

### Location Test

The [runs test](/eda/quantitative/runs-test/) for drift shows no significant trend (p > 0.05). Despite the skewness, the location is stable across the observation sequence. The process generating these fatigue specimens is consistent over time.

### Variation Test

[Bartlett's test](/eda/quantitative/bartletts-test/) across four equal groups does not reject constant variance (p > 0.05). The measurement variability is consistent, even though the data are non-normally distributed. Note that Bartlett's test is sensitive to non-normality, so the [Levene test](/eda/quantitative/levene-test/) provides a more robust confirmation.

### Randomness Tests

The [runs test](/eda/quantitative/runs-test/) confirms randomness (p > 0.05). [Autocorrelation](/eda/quantitative/autocorrelation/) values at all tested lags fall within the significance bounds. The specimens are independent and show no serial correlation in their fatigue lives.

### Distribution Test

The [Anderson-Darling test](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) decisively rejects normality (p < 0.001). The [skewness and kurtosis](/eda/quantitative/skewness-kurtosis/) values are approximately 0.82 and 0.69, respectively. The positive skewness confirms the right-skewed distribution observed in the histogram. A Weibull or lognormal distribution may provide a better fit for these data.

### Outlier Detection

[Grubbs' test](/eda/quantitative/grubbs-test/) based on the normal distribution flags several high values as potential outliers. However, these are not true outliers -- they are expected extreme values from a skewed distribution. Using the Grubbs test on non-normal data produces false positives because the test assumes normality.

## Conclusions

Three of four assumptions are satisfied: fixed location, fixed variation, and randomness. The distributional assumption fails -- the data are strongly right-skewed and not normally distributed. The practical implications are significant: the sample mean is not the most efficient location estimator, and normal-theory confidence intervals will be inaccurate. A [Weibull distribution](/eda/distributions/weibull/) or [lognormal distribution](/eda/distributions/lognormal/) should be fitted to these data. For reliability applications, the lower percentiles of the fitted distribution (B1, B10 life estimates) are more relevant than the mean. This case study demonstrates why the distributional assumption must be verified before applying standard parametric methods.
