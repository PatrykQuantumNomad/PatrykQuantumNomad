## Background and Data

This data set was collected by H. S. Lew of NIST in 1969 to measure steel-concrete beam deflections. The response variable is the deflection of a beam from the center point. This case study applies exploratory data analysis to the NIST LEW.DAT dataset, which contains 200 univariate measurements of beam deflection. The primary purpose is to demonstrate how EDA techniques detect periodic (sinusoidal) structure in what might initially appear to be a random process.

The dataset originates from NIST/SEMATECH Section 1.4.2.5. With <InlineMath tex="n = 200" /> observations, this study illustrates the critical importance of testing the randomness assumption, as the data exhibit cyclic behavior that is invisible to simple location or spread summaries but readily detected by autocorrelation and spectral analysis.

## Test Underlying Assumptions

### Goals

The analysis has three primary objectives:

1. **Model validation** — assess whether the univariate model is an appropriate fit for the beam deflection data:

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="Y_i = C + E_i" />
</div>

2. **Assumption testing** — evaluate whether the data satisfy the four standard assumptions for a measurement process in statistical control:
   - **Random sampling** — the data are uncorrelated
   - **Fixed distribution** — the data come from a fixed distribution
   - **Fixed location** — the distribution location (mean) is constant
   - **Fixed variation** — the distribution scale (standard deviation) is constant

3. **Confidence interval validity** — determine whether the standard confidence interval formula is appropriate:

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="\bar{Y} \pm \frac{2s}{\sqrt{N}}" />
</div>

   where <InlineMath tex="s" /> is the standard deviation. This formula relies on all four assumptions holding; if they are violated, the confidence interval has no statistical meaning.

If the assumptions are violated, identify the nature and severity of the violations and recommend appropriate remedial actions.

## Graphical Output and Interpretation

### 4-Plot Overview

The [4-plot](/eda/techniques/4-plot/) provides a mixed picture. The run sequence plot shows an oscillatory pattern around a stable mean, suggesting periodic structure. The lag plot shows an elliptical pattern indicating positive autocorrelation. The histogram is roughly symmetric and bell-shaped. The normal probability plot is approximately linear. The dominant finding is the failure of the randomness assumption due to cyclic behavior.

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="4-plot" />

The assumptions are addressed by the four diagnostic plots:

1. The **run sequence plot** (upper left) shows an oscillatory pattern around a stable mean of approximately −177, suggesting periodic structure rather than random scatter — the location is stable on average but the data are clearly not random.
2. The **lag plot** (upper right) shows an elliptical structure oriented along the diagonal, indicating strong positive autocorrelation — the randomness assumption is seriously violated.
3. When the randomness assumption is thus seriously violated, the **histogram** (lower left) and **normal probability plot** (lower right) are less meaningful since determining the distribution is only valid when the data are random. Nevertheless, both appear roughly consistent with normality.

From the above plots we conclude that the underlying randomness assumption is not valid. The model <InlineMath tex="Y_i = C + E_i" /> is not appropriate — a model that accounts for the periodic structure is needed.

### Run Sequence Plot

The [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) shows 200 observations fluctuating around a stable mean of approximately −177. Rather than random scatter, the data exhibit a clear oscillatory (sinusoidal) pattern. The location is stable on average, and the variation appears constant, but the sequential ordering reveals periodic structure that would be missed by looking at summary statistics alone.

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="run-sequence" />

### Lag Plot

The [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/) at lag 1 displays an elliptical structure oriented along the diagonal, indicating strong positive autocorrelation. Consecutive observations are correlated — when one value is high, the next tends to be high as well. This elliptical pattern is the signature of a positively autocorrelated process and contrasts sharply with the circular scatter expected from independent data.

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="lag" />

### Histogram

The [histogram](/eda/techniques/histogram/) is roughly symmetric and bell-shaped, centered near −177. The shape is consistent with an approximately normal distribution. The histogram alone gives no indication of the underlying periodic structure because it discards the sequential ordering of observations.

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="histogram" />

### Normal Probability Plot

The [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/) is approximately linear, with data points following the theoretical straight line reasonably well through the central portion of the distribution. Minor deviations in the tails are within expected sampling variability. The marginal distribution is approximately normal, even though the data are not random.

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="probability" />

### Autocorrelation Plot

The [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) reveals the periodic structure in the data. With 95% confidence bands at <InlineMath tex="\pm 2/\sqrt{N} = \pm 0.1414" />, any lag exceeding these bounds indicates significant autocorrelation.

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="autocorrelation" />

The autocorrelation function shows significant positive autocorrelation at multiple lags with a clear periodic pattern. The slow, oscillatory decay confirms the presence of a cyclic component in the data rather than simple drift.

### Spectral Plot

The [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) complements the autocorrelation plot by showing the frequency-domain structure. For the beam deflection data, it reveals the dominant frequency of the sinusoidal component.

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="spectral" />

The spectral plot shows a dominant peak near frequency 0.3 cycles per observation, identifying the period of the sinusoidal component. This frequency information is essential for developing a better model.

## Quantitative Output and Interpretation

### Summary Statistics

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sample size <InlineMath tex="n" /> | 200 |
| Mean <InlineMath tex="\bar{Y}" /> | −177.435 |
| Std Dev <InlineMath tex="s" /> | 277.332 |
| Median | −162.0 |
| Min | −579.0 |
| Max | 300.0 |
| Range | 879.0 |

The mean and median are reasonably close, consistent with the approximate symmetry observed in the histogram. The large standard deviation relative to the mean reflects the wide oscillation of the deflection measurements around the central value.

### Location Test

The location test fits a linear regression of the response <InlineMath tex="Y" /> against the run-order index <InlineMath tex="X = 1, 2, \ldots, N" /> and tests whether the slope is significantly different from zero.

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="H_0\!: B_1 = 0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a\!: B_1 \neq 0" />
</div>

| Parameter | Estimate | Std Error | t-Value |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| <InlineMath tex="B_0" /> (intercept) | −178.175 | 39.47 | −4.514 |
| <InlineMath tex="B_1" /> (slope) | 0.7366E-02 | 0.34 | 0.022 |

Residual standard deviation: 278.0313 with 198 degrees of freedom.

**Conclusion:** The slope t-value of 0.022 is far below the critical value <InlineMath tex="t_{0.975,\,198} = 1.96" />, so we **fail to reject** <InlineMath tex="H_0" /> — the location is constant. The overall mean is stable at approximately −177 across the full dataset. The **fixed-location assumption is satisfied**.

### Variation Test

The [Levene test](/eda/quantitative/levene-test/) (median-based variant) divides the data into <InlineMath tex="k = 4" /> equal-length intervals and tests whether their variances are homogeneous.

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="H_0\!: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = \sigma_3^2 = \sigma_4^2 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a\!: \text{at least one } \sigma_i^2 \text{ differs}" />
</div>

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Test statistic <InlineMath tex="W" /> | 0.09378 |
| Degrees of freedom | <InlineMath tex="k - 1 = 3" /> and <InlineMath tex="N - k = 196" /> |
| Significance level <InlineMath tex="\alpha" /> | 0.05 |
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="F_{0.05,\,3,\,196}" /> | 2.651 |

**Conclusion:** The test statistic of 0.09378 is far below the critical value of 2.651, so we **fail to reject** <InlineMath tex="H_0" /> — the variances are consistent across all four intervals. The **fixed-variation assumption is satisfied**.

### Randomness Tests

Two complementary tests assess whether the observations are independent.

**Runs test** — tests whether the sequence of values above and below the median was produced randomly.

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="H_0\!: \text{sequence is random} \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a\!: \text{sequence is not random}" />
</div>

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Test statistic <InlineMath tex="Z" /> | 2.6938 |
| Significance level <InlineMath tex="\alpha" /> | 0.05 |
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="Z_{1-\alpha/2}" /> | 1.96 |

**Conclusion:** <InlineMath tex="|Z| = 2.6938" /> exceeds 1.96, so we **reject** <InlineMath tex="H_0" /> — the data are not random. The positive Z indicates fewer runs than expected, meaning the data cluster in long sequences above or below the median, consistent with the periodic structure visible in the run sequence plot.

**Lag-1 autocorrelation** — measures the linear dependence between consecutive observations.

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Critical value <InlineMath tex="2/\sqrt{N}" /> | <InlineMath tex="2/\sqrt{200} = 0.1414" /> |

The [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) reveals significant positive autocorrelation at multiple lags, with values well exceeding the significance bounds of <InlineMath tex="\pm 0.1414" />. The autocorrelation function decays slowly and shows periodic structure, confirming the presence of a cyclic component. A [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) shows a dominant peak at frequency 0.3, identifying the frequency of the sinusoidal component. The **randomness assumption fails**.

### Distribution and Outlier Tests

Since the randomness assumption is violated, distributional tests are not meaningful. The NIST handbook explicitly omits the [Anderson-Darling test](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) and [skewness and kurtosis](/eda/quantitative/skewness-kurtosis/) analysis for this case study, noting that these quantitative tests are not meaningful when the data are not independent.

Outliers are identified graphically from the [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/) rather than by formal testing. The lag plot reveals a few observations that fall well outside the main elliptical cloud, corresponding to potential outliers that warrant investigation.

### Test Summary

| Assumption | Test | Statistic | Critical Value | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fixed location** | Regression on run order | <InlineMath tex="t = 0.022" /> | 1.96 | **Fail to reject** |
| **Fixed variation** | [Levene test](/eda/quantitative/levene-test/) | <InlineMath tex="W = 0.09378" /> | 2.651 | **Fail to reject** |
| **Randomness** | [Runs test](/eda/quantitative/runs-test/) | <InlineMath tex="Z = 2.6938" /> | 1.96 | **Reject** |
| **Randomness** | [Autocorrelation](/eda/quantitative/autocorrelation/) | Exceeds bounds | <InlineMath tex="\pm 0.1414" /> | **Reject** |
| **Distribution** | — | — | — | Not meaningful |
| **Outliers** | — | — | — | Not meaningful |

Two of four assumptions hold: fixed location and fixed variation. The randomness assumption is rejected, which invalidates distributional testing. The univariate model <InlineMath tex="Y_i = C + E_i" /> is **not appropriate** for this data due to the periodic structure.

## Develop a Better Model

The autocorrelation and spectral analysis reveal that the non-randomness in the beam deflection data is periodic (sinusoidal) rather than drift-based. The spectral plot identifies a dominant frequency near 0.3 cycles per observation. This motivates a sinusoidal model:

<div class="my-4 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-center">
  <InlineMath tex="Y_i = B_0 + B_1 \sin(2\pi f t_i + \phi) + E_i" />
</div>

where <InlineMath tex="f \approx 0.3025" /> is the dominant frequency identified by spectral analysis. Fitting this model by least squares yields residuals that should satisfy all four assumptions if the sinusoidal component has been successfully removed.

The dominant frequency <InlineMath tex="f \approx 0.3025" /> was determined from the [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/), which shows a single prominent peak. NIST used [complex demodulation](/eda/techniques/complex-demodulation/) to refine the starting frequency estimate before applying nonlinear least squares regression to fit the four-parameter sinusoidal model simultaneously.

### Model Parameters

The nonlinear regression produces the following parameter estimates:

| Parameter | Estimate | Std Error | t-Value |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| <InlineMath tex="C" /> (constant) | <InlineMath tex="-178.786" /> | 11.02 | <InlineMath tex="-16.22" /> |
| <InlineMath tex="\alpha" /> (amplitude) | <InlineMath tex="-361.766" /> | 26.19 | <InlineMath tex="-13.81" /> |
| <InlineMath tex="\omega" /> (frequency) | <InlineMath tex="0.302596" /> | 0.0001510 | <InlineMath tex="2005" /> |
| <InlineMath tex="\phi" /> (phase) | <InlineMath tex="1.46536" /> | 0.04909 | <InlineMath tex="29.85" /> |

Residual standard deviation: <InlineMath tex="s_e = 155.8484" /> with 196 degrees of freedom.

All four parameters are highly significant. The frequency t-value of <InlineMath tex="2005" /> reflects the fact that the sinusoidal period is very precisely determined by the 200 observations. The residual standard deviation of <InlineMath tex="155.8" /> represents a **44% reduction** from the original data's standard deviation of <InlineMath tex="277.3" />, confirming that the sinusoidal model captures a substantial portion of the data's variability.

NIST notes that three potential outliers are present in the residuals and that removing them would reduce the residual standard deviation by approximately 5% (from 155.8 to 148.3). However, they conclude that retaining or removing the outliers is "a judgment call" -- the full-data fit is presented here as the primary result.

## Validate New Model

### 4-Plot of Residuals

The [4-plot](/eda/techniques/4-plot/) applied to the residuals from the sinusoidal model tests whether the error term satisfies all four assumptions.

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="residual-4-plot" />

The transformation compared to the original data's 4-plot is dramatic:

- **Run sequence plot** (upper left) -- the oscillatory pattern is gone; residuals fluctuate randomly around zero with no systematic structure
- **Lag plot** (upper right) -- the elliptical dependence structure is replaced by a random, structureless cloud
- **Histogram** (lower left) -- approximately symmetric and bell-shaped, consistent with normality
- **Normal probability plot** (lower right) -- approximately linear with minor curvature in the left tail, suggesting the residuals are close to but not perfectly normal

### Residual Run Sequence Plot

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="residual-run-sequence" />

The residuals fluctuate randomly around zero with no oscillatory pattern, no trend, and no visible shifts in variability -- the **fixed-location and fixed-variation assumptions are satisfied**.

### Residual Lag Plot

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="residual-lag" />

The residual lag plot shows a random, structureless cloud replacing the tight elliptical pattern of the original data -- the **randomness assumption is satisfied**. The sinusoidal model has successfully removed the periodic dependence.

### Residual Histogram

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="residual-histogram" />

The residual histogram is approximately symmetric and bell-shaped, centered near zero. The shape is consistent with a normal distribution, though a slight leftward tail asymmetry is visible.

### Residual Normal Probability Plot

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="residual-probability" />

The normal probability plot of residuals is approximately linear through the central portion. A bend in the left tail suggests some departure from normality -- NIST notes this as "some cause for concern" but concludes the fit is "reasonably good." The **distribution is approximately normal**.

### Residual Autocorrelation Plot

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="residual-autocorrelation" />

The residual autocorrelation is dramatically reduced compared to the original data. Most lags fall within the 95% confidence bands of <InlineMath tex="\pm 0.1414" />, confirming that the sinusoidal model has successfully removed the periodic dependence structure. The **randomness assumption is satisfied**.

### Residual Spectral Plot

<BeamDeflectionPlots type="residual-spectral" />

The residual spectral plot shows a relatively flat spectrum with no dominant peaks. The prominent peak near frequency 0.3 in the original data's [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) has been eliminated, confirming that the sinusoidal model has captured the periodic component.

### Validation Summary

| Assumption | Original Data | Residuals | Improvement |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Fixed location** | Satisfied (<InlineMath tex="t = 0.022" />) | Satisfied -- no shifts in residual location | Maintained |
| **Fixed variation** | Satisfied (<InlineMath tex="W = 0.09378" />) | Satisfied -- stable residual spread | Maintained |
| **Randomness** | **Rejected** (<InlineMath tex="Z = 2.6938" />) | Satisfied -- no significant autocorrelation | **Restored** |
| **Distribution** | Not tested (randomness violated) | Approximately normal (minor left-tail departure) | Now testable |
| **Outliers** | Not tested (randomness violated) | 3 potential outliers (NIST) | Now assessable |

The sinusoidal model restores the randomness assumption while maintaining the satisfied location and variation assumptions. Distribution testing, which was not meaningful for the original data due to the randomness violation, now shows the residuals are approximately normally distributed. The overall fit is "reasonably good" per NIST's assessment, with the caveat that a slight left-tail departure from normality and three potential outliers warrant consideration.

## Conclusions

Two of four assumptions hold for the original data: fixed location and fixed variation. The normality assumption was not tested because the randomness assumption is severely violated, making distributional tests invalid. The critical failure is in the randomness assumption — the autocorrelation plot and spectral analysis reveal significant periodic (sinusoidal) structure in the data. Consecutive observations are positively correlated, and the spectral plot identifies a dominant cyclic period at frequency 0.3.

A simple mean-based model is inadequate for these data. The sinusoidal model <InlineMath tex="Y_i = B_0 + B_1 \sin(2\pi f t_i + \phi) + E_i" /> captures the periodic structure identified by spectral analysis. Residual validation confirms that the sinusoidal model successfully removes the periodic component, with the residual autocorrelation plot showing dramatically reduced dependence compared to the original data. This case study demonstrates that summary statistics and distributional plots can appear perfectly acceptable while masking serious departures from the independence assumption, making the [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) and [spectral analysis](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) indispensable tools in any EDA analysis.
