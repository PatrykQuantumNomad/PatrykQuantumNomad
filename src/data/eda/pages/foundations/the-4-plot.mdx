## The Universal First-Pass Diagnostic

The 4-plot is arguably the single most important diagnostic tool in Exploratory Data Analysis. As described in Section 1.2.4 of the NIST/SEMATECH Engineering Statistics Handbook, it is designed to test all four underlying assumptions -- fixed location, fixed variation, randomness, and fixed distribution -- in a single, compact display. Before running any formal analysis, the 4-plot gives you a rapid health check of your data.

The power of the 4-plot lies in its comprehensiveness. Rather than checking assumptions one at a time with separate tools, the analyst can assess all four simultaneously and see how they interact. A dataset that passes all four panels of the 4-plot is ready for standard statistical analysis; a dataset that fails one or more panels requires investigation before proceeding.

## The Four Panels

The 4-plot arranges four diagnostic graphics in a fixed layout. Each panel targets a specific assumption.

### Panel 1: Run Sequence Plot (Upper Left)

The [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) displays the data in the order they were collected, with the observation index on the horizontal axis and the measured value on the vertical axis.

**What to look for:**
- **Fixed location:** The data should scatter randomly around a constant horizontal level. Visible trends, step changes, or oscillations indicate that the location is shifting over time.
- **Fixed variation:** The vertical spread of points should remain roughly constant from left to right. A funnel shape (widening or narrowing) suggests changing variance.

### Panel 2: Lag Plot (Upper Right)

The [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/) graphs each observation against the immediately preceding observation. If the data are truly random and independent, the lag plot will show a structureless cloud of points.

**What to look for:**
- **Randomness:** A circular or blob-shaped scatter with no apparent pattern confirms independence. Diagonal linear structure indicates positive autocorrelation; an X pattern indicates negative autocorrelation; curved patterns suggest a nonlinear time-dependent process.

### Panel 3: Histogram (Lower Left)

The [histogram](/eda/techniques/histogram/) bins the data and displays the frequency distribution as a bar chart. It reveals the overall shape of the data's distribution without imposing any assumed model.

**What to look for:**
- **Distribution shape:** Is the distribution symmetric and bell-shaped (suggesting normality), skewed to one side, bimodal (two peaks), or uniform? The presence of multiple modes may indicate that the data come from a mixture of populations.
- **Outliers:** Isolated bars far from the main mass of data point to potential outliers that warrant investigation.

### Panel 4: Normal Probability Plot (Lower Right)

The [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/) is the most sensitive of the four panels for assessing whether the data follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution. It plots the ordered data values against the theoretical quantiles of the standard normal distribution.

**What to look for:**
- **Normality:** If the data are normally distributed, the points will fall approximately on a straight line. Curvature in the tails indicates heavy tails (S-shape) or light tails (reverse S). Systematic departure from linearity suggests the data come from a different distribution family.

## Interpreting the Combined Evidence

The real strength of the 4-plot is in reading all four panels together. Here are common patterns:

- **All four panels clean:** The data satisfy all standard assumptions. Proceed with parametric analysis (t-tests, ANOVA, regression).
- **Run sequence shows a trend, other panels noisy:** The location is shifting. Before analyzing, detrend the data or model the trend explicitly.
- **Lag plot shows structure:** The data are autocorrelated. Standard error formulas will underestimate uncertainty. Consider time-series methods or subsample to reduce dependence.
- **Histogram bimodal, probability plot curved:** The data likely come from a mixture of two populations. Investigate whether a grouping variable can separate them.
- **Probability plot shows heavy tails:** The normal assumption is violated. Consider transformations (log, Box-Cox) or use robust/non-parametric methods.

## Beyond the 4-Plot

When the 4-plot reveals a violation, deeper investigation is needed. The [6-plot](/eda/techniques/6-plot/) extends the 4-plot with two additional panels (a fitted linear plot and residual-based diagnostics) for more detailed assessment. Formal hypothesis tests -- the [runs test](/eda/quantitative/runs-test/) for randomness, the [Anderson-Darling test](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) for normality -- can quantify what the 4-plot reveals visually. See [When Assumptions Fail](/eda/foundations/when-assumptions-fail/) for guidance on remedial actions.
