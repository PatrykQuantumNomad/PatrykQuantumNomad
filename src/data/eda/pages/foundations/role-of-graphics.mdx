## Why Graphics Are Central to EDA

The NIST/SEMATECH Engineering Statistics Handbook devotes Section 1.1.5 to the role of graphics because visualization is not merely helpful in EDA -- it is foundational. Summary statistics such as the mean and standard deviation compress an entire dataset into one or two numbers. That compression is useful for communication, but it inevitably discards information. A graphical display preserves the richness of the data: its shape, its outliers, its clusters, and its gaps.

The human visual system is extraordinarily good at detecting patterns. We perceive trends, clusters, gaps, and anomalies in a scatter plot almost instantaneously -- long before a formal test could be specified. EDA leverages this perceptual strength by making graphics the primary investigative tool rather than an afterthought.

## Anscombe's Quartet: The Case for Visualization

Perhaps the most famous illustration of why graphics matter is Anscombe's quartet (1973). Four datasets share nearly identical summary statistics -- the same mean, variance, correlation coefficient, and regression line -- yet their scatter plots are dramatically different. One is linear, one is curved, one contains an influential outlier, and one has a single leverage point that determines the regression. No numerical summary alone can distinguish them; only a [scatter plot](/eda/techniques/scatter-plot/) reveals the truth.

This example underscores a core EDA principle: always plot your data before computing summary statistics. The statistics may confirm what the plot shows, but they can never replace it.

## The Spectrum of Graphical Techniques

EDA draws on a wide range of graphical methods, from simple to sophisticated:

- **Univariate displays** such as the [histogram](/eda/techniques/histogram/) and [box plot](/eda/techniques/box-plot/) show the distribution of a single variable -- its center, spread, skewness, and outliers.
- **Bivariate displays** such as the [scatter plot](/eda/techniques/scatter-plot/) reveal relationships between two variables, including linearity, curvature, and heteroscedasticity.
- **Diagnostic displays** such as the [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/) and [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/) test specific assumptions about the data-generating process.
- **Multi-panel displays** such as the [4-plot](/eda/techniques/4-plot/) and [6-plot](/eda/techniques/6-plot/) combine several diagnostics into a single view for rapid assumption checking.

The choice of technique depends on the question being asked and the structure of the data. Section 1.1.5 of the Handbook emphasizes that no single plot is sufficient; effective EDA uses multiple complementary views.

## Graphics vs. Quantitative Summaries

Graphical and quantitative methods serve different but complementary roles. Quantitative summaries -- [measures of location](/eda/quantitative/measures-of-location/), [measures of scale](/eda/quantitative/measures-of-scale/), [skewness and kurtosis](/eda/quantitative/skewness-kurtosis/) -- provide precise numerical characterizations that are easy to compare across datasets. Graphics provide context that those numbers lack: the overall shape of the distribution, the presence of multiple modes, and the nature of departures from an assumed model.

In practice, EDA alternates between graphical exploration and quantitative confirmation. A histogram may suggest that the data are right-skewed; a skewness statistic quantifies how much. A normal probability plot may show curvature in the tails; an [Anderson-Darling test](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) provides a formal p-value. Neither approach is complete without the other.
