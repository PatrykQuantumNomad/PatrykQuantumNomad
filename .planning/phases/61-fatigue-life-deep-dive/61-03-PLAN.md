<objective>
Add the Interpretation section that synthesizes all graphical and quantitative evidence, and update the Conclusions section to reference the full analysis.

Purpose: FAT-04 requires an Interpretation section synthesizing graphical and quantitative evidence including distribution selection reasoning. This is the final content plan that ties together the restructured graphical analysis (Plan 01), distribution comparison plots, and quantitative test battery (Plan 02) into a cohesive synthesis.

Output: Complete Interpretation section and updated Conclusions in fatigue-life.mdx

  <files>src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/fatigue-life.mdx</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Add "## Interpretation" section**

Insert "## Interpretation" AFTER the "### Prediction Intervals" subsection and BEFORE "## Conclusions". Follow the Phase 57 established 3-paragraph pattern:

Paragraph 1 -- Overall assessment of the three core assumptions:
- Reference the run sequence plot, lag plot, and autocorrelation plot as graphical evidence
- Reference the specific test statistics from the Test Summary (location t-test, Bartlett test, runs test, lag-1 autocorrelation) with their computed values using InlineMath
- State that fixed location, fixed variation, and randomness are all satisfied
- State that the distributional assumption is the central analytical challenge for this dataset
- Include cross-reference links to technique pages: [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/), [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/), [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/), [Bartlett test](/eda/quantitative/bartletts-test/)

Paragraph 2 -- Distribution comparison finding (the key insight of this case study):
- Reference the histogram's visual right-skewness
- Reference the three probability plots: normal (with tail deviations), Weibull (reasonable fit), and gamma (good fit)
- Reference the AIC/BIC model comparison that decisively favors the Gaussian model (posterior probability 76%) over Gamma (16%), Weibull (7.4%), and Birnbaum-Saunders (0.27%)
- State the counterintuitive finding: despite visual skewness, the Gaussian model provides the best formal fit
- Reference the Anderson-Darling and PPCC results as supplementary evidence
- Include cross-reference links: [histogram](/eda/techniques/histogram/), [probability plots](/eda/techniques/probability-plot/), [normal](/eda/distributions/normal/), [Weibull](/eda/distributions/weibull/), [gamma](/eda/distributions/gamma/)

Paragraph 3 -- Practical implications:
- Reference the 0.1st percentile (B0.1 life) estimate of 198 thousand cycles
- Reference the bootstrap 95% CI of (40, 366) thousand cycles
- Note the wide CI reflects uncertainty in extreme-tail estimation from 101 observations
- State the pedagogical lesson: visual impressions of distributional shape should be confirmed by formal model selection criteria before choosing an alternative to the normal distribution
- This is the defining message of the fatigue life case study

Use definitive language (not hedging like "should show") per Phase 60 decision.

**Step 2: Update "## Conclusions" section**

Replace the current Conclusions with an updated version that:
- References the quantitative test results (location stable, variation constant, randomness confirmed)
- References the distribution comparison findings (AIC/BIC favoring Gaussian)
- References the probability plot evidence
- Keeps the existing key messages about visual skewness vs. formal model selection
- Keeps the existing reference to B1, B10 life estimates and bootstrap CIs
- Adds cross-reference links to distribution pages: [Weibull](/eda/distributions/weibull/), [gamma](/eda/distributions/gamma/), [normal](/eda/distributions/normal/)

The Conclusions should be more concise than the Interpretation (1-2 paragraphs), summarizing the key takeaways without repeating all the evidence.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT change any content outside of the Interpretation and Conclusions sections. All prior sections (Background, Test Underlying Assumptions, Graphical Output, Quantitative Output) should remain exactly as completed by Plans 01 and 02.

  <done>
- "## Interpretation" section exists between Prediction Intervals and Conclusions
- Interpretation has 3 paragraphs following Phase 57 pattern
- Paragraph 1 references specific test statistics with InlineMath and cross-reference links
- Paragraph 2 discusses distribution comparison with AIC/BIC evidence and probability plot findings
- Paragraph 3 covers practical implications (B0.1 life, bootstrap CI, pedagogical lesson)
- Conclusions section references both graphical and quantitative evidence
- Uses definitive language (no hedging)
- Cross-reference links to technique pages, quantitative pages, and distribution pages are present
- `npx astro check` reports 0 errors
- `npx astro build` completes successfully

- grep for "## Interpretation" in fatigue-life.mdx confirms section exists
- grep for "AIC" in the Interpretation section confirms distribution selection reasoning
- grep for "posterior probability" or "76%" in Interpretation confirms quantitative evidence
- grep for "B0.1" or "0.1st percentile" or "198" in Interpretation confirms practical implications
- The section ordering is: ... > Prediction Intervals > Interpretation > Conclusions
</verification>

<success_criteria>
The Interpretation section synthesizes all evidence from the case study into a coherent narrative that explains the counterintuitive finding (Gaussian wins despite visual skewness), references specific test statistics and AIC/BIC values, and provides practical implications for reliability engineering. The Conclusions section is updated to reflect the complete analysis. The full build passes.
