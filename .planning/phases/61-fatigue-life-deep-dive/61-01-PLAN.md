<objective>
Restructure the Fatigue Life MDX to match the Distribution Focus Variation canonical template with individually named plot subsections.

Purpose: FAT-01 requires individual named plot subsections with per-plot interpretation. The current MDX bundles histogram and box plot under "### Initial Plots" and has the 4-Plot after Normal Probability Plot instead of first. This plan reorganizes headings to canonical order while preserving all existing content.

Output: Restructured fatigue-life.mdx with canonical heading structure

  <name>Task 1: Add Test Underlying Assumptions section and restructure graphical subsections to canonical order</name>
  <files>src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/fatigue-life.mdx</files>
  <action>
Restructure the fatigue-life.mdx to match the Distribution Focus Variation canonical template. This is content reorganization only -- no new content, no new components, just moving existing sections to the correct order and adding the missing structural sections.

Changes to make:

1. After "## Background and Data" (keep as-is), ADD these new sections:

```
## Test Underlying Assumptions

### Goals

The goals of this analysis are:

1. Determine if the fatigue life data can be adequately modeled with a known probability distribution for reliability prediction
2. Assess the fixed-location assumption: is the process mean stable over the run?
3. Assess the fixed-variation assumption: is the process variability constant?
4. Assess the randomness assumption: are the observations independent?
5. Determine which probability distribution (Normal, Gamma, Weibull, or Birnbaum-Saunders) best describes the fatigue life dispersion
```

2. "## Graphical Output and Interpretation" heading stays. Reorder subsections under it to canonical order:

CURRENT ORDER:
- ### Initial Plots (histogram + box-plot)
- ### Normal Probability Plot
- ### 4-Plot Overview
- ### Run Sequence Plot
- ### Lag Plot
- ### Candidate Distribution Comparison
- ### Autocorrelation Plot
- ### Spectral Plot

NEW ORDER:
- ### 4-Plot Overview (move to first position, keep all existing content including the numbered list)
- ### Box Plot (extract from "Initial Plots" -- keep existing box plot interpretation text, keep `<FatigueLifePlots type="box-plot" />`)
- ### Run Sequence Plot (keep as-is)
- ### Lag Plot (keep as-is)
- ### Histogram (extract from "Initial Plots" -- keep existing histogram interpretation text, keep `<FatigueLifePlots type="histogram" />`)
- ### Normal Probability Plot (keep as-is)
- ### Autocorrelation Plot (keep as-is)
- ### Spectral Plot (keep as-is)
- ### Distribution Comparison (rename from "### Candidate Distribution Comparison", keep existing content about 4 candidate distributions)

3. Split "### Initial Plots" into two standalone subsections:
   - "### Histogram" gets: The paragraph about data ranging from 350 to 2500 is shared context that belongs in the histogram interpretation. Create a standalone histogram subsection with the `<FatigueLifePlots type="histogram" />` component and the description of the right-skewed distribution and clustering between 800-1600.
   - "### Box Plot" gets: The mention of potential outlier at largest value. Create a standalone subsection with `<FatigueLifePlots type="box-plot" />` and description of the box plot findings.

4. The "### Candidate Distribution Comparison" heading becomes "### Distribution Comparison" (no content changes -- the Weibull/gamma probability plot sub-subsections will be added in Plan 02).

5. Keep all content under "## Quantitative Output and Interpretation" and "## Conclusions" exactly as-is. Those will be modified in Plans 02 and 03.

IMPORTANT: Preserve EVERY existing paragraph of interpretation text. Do not drop or summarize any content. The restructure moves text between headings but does not delete or rewrite.

  <done>
- fatigue-life.mdx has "## Test Underlying Assumptions" with "### Goals" subsection
- Graphical subsections appear in canonical order: 4-Plot, Box Plot, Run Sequence, Lag, Histogram, Normal Probability, Autocorrelation, Spectral, Distribution Comparison
- "### Initial Plots" heading no longer exists -- replaced by standalone "### Histogram" and "### Box Plot"
- All 8 FatigueLifePlots component calls are present
- All existing interpretation paragraphs are preserved
- `npx astro check` reports 0 errors
  </done>

<verification>
- grep for "### Initial Plots" in fatigue-life.mdx should return nothing (removed)
- grep for "### 4-Plot Overview" should be the first H3 subsection under Graphical Output
- grep for "### Box Plot" should exist as a standalone subsection
- grep for "### Histogram" should exist as a standalone subsection (not under "Initial Plots")
- grep for "### Distribution Comparison" should exist (renamed from "Candidate Distribution Comparison")
- grep for "## Test Underlying Assumptions" should exist before Graphical Output
- Total FatigueLifePlots component calls should be 8 (unchanged)
- `npx astro check` reports 0 errors

<success_criteria>
The fatigue-life.mdx follows the Distribution Focus Variation canonical template heading structure. All 8 plot types have individually named subsections with per-plot interpretation. No content has been lost in the restructure.

After completion, create `.planning/phases/61-fatigue-life-deep-dive/61-01-SUMMARY.md`
