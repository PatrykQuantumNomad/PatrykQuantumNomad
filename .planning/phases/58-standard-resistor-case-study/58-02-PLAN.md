  <action>
Create `src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/standard-resistor.mdx` following the Filter Transmittance MDX as the structural template. This is an assumption-violating case study (3 of 4 assumptions fail), so it follows the same pattern of omitting distribution/outlier tests.

title: "Standard Resistor Case Study"
description: "EDA case study analyzing NIST standard resistor data to demonstrate detection of drift in location, non-constant variation, and non-randomness caused by seasonal humidity effects on measurement equipment"
section: "1.4.2"
category: "case-studies"
nistSection: "1.4.2.7 Standard Resistor"
---
```

**Imports (immediately after frontmatter):**
```mdx
import CaseStudyDataset from '../../../../components/eda/CaseStudyDataset.astro';
import InlineMath from '../../../../components/eda/InlineMath.astro';
import StandardResistorPlots from '../../../../components/eda/StandardResistorPlots.astro';
```

**Section structure (follow this EXACTLY):**

### `## Background and Data`
- Dataset: Ron Dziuba, NIST, 1980-1985. 1000 observations of a standard resistor's resistance in ohms.
- Purpose: Demonstrate how EDA detects drift in location, non-constant variation, and non-randomness caused by seasonal humidity effects.
- Response variable: Resistance (ohms), ranging from approximately 27.828 to 28.115.
- NIST Section 1.4.2.7 reference.
- Include `<CaseStudyDataset slug="standard-resistor" />`

### `## Test Underlying Assumptions`
#### `### Goals`
Same pattern as Filter Transmittance: three objectives (model validation with univariate model Y_i = C + E_i, assumption testing for the four standard assumptions, confidence interval validity). Use InlineMath for formulas.

### `## Graphical Output and Interpretation`

#### `### 4-Plot Overview`
- Link to [4-plot](/eda/techniques/4-plot/) technique page
- `<StandardResistorPlots type="4-plot" />`
- Numbered interpretation of all 4 quadrants: (1) run sequence shows persistent upward drift, (2) lag plot shows extreme linear pattern (r1=0.97), (3) histogram and (4) probability plot not meaningful due to severe autocorrelation

#### `### Run Sequence Plot`
- Link to [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/)
- Describe: 1000 observations showing persistent upward drift over the 5-year period. Seasonal variation visible as periodic fluctuations superimposed on the trend. The drift is consistent with physical aging of the resistor and environmental humidity effects.
- **Conclusion:** bold statement that fixed-location assumption is violated
- `<StandardResistorPlots type="run-sequence" />`

#### `### Lag Plot`
- Link to [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/)
- Tight linear cluster along diagonal indicating extreme autocorrelation (r1 = 0.97). More extreme than Filter Transmittance (0.94).
- **Conclusion:** randomness assumption is severely violated
- `<StandardResistorPlots type="lag" />`

#### `### Histogram`
- Link to [histogram](/eda/techniques/histogram/)
- Because randomness is severely violated (r1 = 0.97), histogram does not represent distribution of independent errors. Shape reflects drift structure.
- `<StandardResistorPlots type="histogram" />`

#### `### Normal Probability Plot`
- Link to [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/)
- Same caveat as histogram — not meaningful for distributional assessment when data are severely autocorrelated.
- `<StandardResistorPlots type="probability" />`

#### `### Autocorrelation Plot`
- Link to [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/)
- With n=1000, 95% confidence bands at +/- 2/sqrt(1000) = +/- 0.063. Use InlineMath.
- Extreme positive autocorrelation persisting to very high lags, consistent with long-term drift and seasonal patterns.
- `<StandardResistorPlots type="autocorrelation" />`

#### `### Spectral Plot`
- Link to [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/)
- Dominant low-frequency content from the long-term drift. May show periodic component from seasonal humidity effects.
- `<StandardResistorPlots type="spectral" />`

### `## Quantitative Output and Interpretation`

#### `### Summary Statistics`
Table with InlineMath notation:
| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sample size n | 1000 |
| Mean Y-bar | 28.01634 |
| Median | 28.02910 |
| Min | 27.82800 |
| Max | 28.11850 |
| Range | 0.29050 |
| Std Dev s | 0.06349 |
| Autocorrelation r1 | 0.97 |

Commentary on confidence interval being invalid with r1=0.97. With effective sample size far smaller than 1000, standard CI has no statistical justification.

#### `### Location Test`
- Linear regression of Y against run-order index X = 1, 2, ..., 1000
- H0: B1 = 0 vs Ha: B1 != 0 (use InlineMath)
- Slope t-value = 100.2 (massive — far exceeds critical value ~1.96 for df=998)
- Note: slope is numerically tiny (0.00021) but t-value is enormous because residual variation is very small
- **Conclusion:** REJECT — location is not constant, significant upward drift

#### `### Variation Test`
- Levene test (median-based), k=4 equal-length intervals
- H0: sigma_1^2 = sigma_2^2 = sigma_3^2 = sigma_4^2
- W = 140.85, critical F(0.05, 3, 996) = 2.614
- **Conclusion:** REJECT — variation is not constant. The seasonal humidity pattern causes different measurement variability in different portions of the 5-year period.

#### `### Randomness Tests`
**Runs test:**
- Z = -30.5629, critical 1.96
- **Conclusion:** REJECT — far fewer runs than expected

**Lag-1 autocorrelation:**
- r1 = 0.97, critical +/- 2/sqrt(1000) = +/- 0.063
- **Conclusion:** REJECT — most extreme autocorrelation in the case study collection. Each measurement explains ~94% of the variance of the next (r1^2 ~ 0.94).

#### `### Distribution and Outlier Tests`
Since randomness is rejected (r1=0.97), distributional tests are not meaningful and are omitted. Same reasoning as Filter Transmittance. Both Grubbs' test and Anderson-Darling/PPCC normality tests assume independent data.

#### `### Test Summary`
Table matching Filter Transmittance pattern:
| Assumption | Test | Statistic | Critical Value | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fixed location | Regression on run order | t = 100.2 | ~1.96 | **Reject** |
| Fixed variation | Levene test | W = 140.85 | 2.614 | **Reject** |
| Randomness | Runs test | Z = -30.5629 | 1.96 | **Reject** |
| Randomness | Autocorrelation lag-1 | r1 = 0.97 | 0.063 | **Reject** |
| Distribution | — | — | — | Not meaningful |
| Outliers | — | — | — | Not meaningful |

Summary prose: Three of the four assumptions are violated. Only the distribution assumption is not directly testable (because randomness must hold first). The univariate model Y_i = C + E_i is not appropriate.

### `## Interpretation`
Synthesize all evidence (per Phase 57 decision — interpretation synthesizes rather than restates):
- Three simultaneous violations (location, variation, randomness) — unlike Filter Transmittance which had only two
- Severity: slope t=100.2 (massive drift), Levene W=140.85 (massive variation change), r1=0.97 (most extreme autocorrelation in the collection)
- The run sequence plot shows both a long-term upward trend and periodic seasonal fluctuations
- The lag plot immediately reveals the extreme autocorrelation
- The spectral plot confirms low-frequency dominance
- Standard confidence interval is completely invalid
- Root cause: seasonal humidity effects on measurement equipment + physical aging of resistor

### `## Conclusions`
- Three of four assumptions violated: location (drift), variation (seasonal humidity), randomness (extreme autocorrelation)
- Standard confidence interval is not valid
- Root cause: seasonal humidity effects on measurement equipment caused non-constant variation, physical aging caused drift in location, and measurements close in time are taken under similar conditions causing extreme autocorrelation
- Recommended action: account for environmental factors in the measurement process; apply time-series or seasonal adjustment models if continued monitoring is needed
- Cross-reference: link to relevant technique pages (lag plot, run sequence plot, spectral plot, Levene test, runs test, autocorrelation)

**Critical formatting notes:**
- ALL statistical values use `<InlineMath tex="..." />` notation (not plain text or markdown math)
- Cross-reference links use relative paths: `/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/`, `/eda/quantitative/levene-test/`, etc.
- Hypothesis test formulas use centered `<div>` blocks matching Filter Transmittance pattern
- Heading structure MUST match: `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections
