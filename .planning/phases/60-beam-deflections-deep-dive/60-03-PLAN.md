<objective>
Add the Validation Summary table, Interpretation section, and update Conclusions in beam-deflections.mdx to complete BEAM-04 and BEAM-05.

Purpose: BEAM-04 requires a validation summary table comparing original vs. residual assumption test results. BEAM-05 requires an Interpretation section synthesizing all evidence. This plan delivers the synthesis layer that ties together the original analysis (done), model development (60-02), and residual diagnostics (60-01) into a coherent narrative.

Output: Updated beam-deflections.mdx with Validation Summary table, 3-paragraph Interpretation section, and updated Conclusions referencing model parameters and validation findings.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Validation Summary table</name>
  <files>src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/beam-deflections.mdx</files>
  <action>
Add a "### Validation Summary" subsection in the "## Validate New Model" section, AFTER the last residual plot subsection (Residual Spectral Plot, added by 60-01) and BEFORE "## Interpretation" (or before "## Conclusions" if Interpretation does not exist yet -- Task 2 will add it).

Insert the following content:

```mdx
### Validation Summary

| Assumption | Original Data | Residuals | Improvement |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Fixed location** | Satisfied (<InlineMath tex="t = 0.022" />) | Satisfied -- no shifts in residual location | Maintained |
| **Fixed variation** | Satisfied (<InlineMath tex="W = 0.09378" />) | Satisfied -- stable residual spread | Maintained |
| **Randomness** | **Rejected** (<InlineMath tex="Z = 2.6938" />) | Satisfied -- no significant autocorrelation | **Restored** |
| **Distribution** | Not tested (randomness violated) | Approximately normal (minor left-tail departure) | Now testable |
| **Outliers** | Not tested (randomness violated) | 3 potential outliers (NIST) | Now assessable |

The sinusoidal model restores the randomness assumption while maintaining the satisfied location and variation assumptions. Distribution testing, which was not meaningful for the original data due to the randomness violation, now shows the residuals are approximately normally distributed. The overall fit is "reasonably good" per NIST's assessment, with the caveat that a slight left-tail departure from normality and three potential outliers warrant consideration.
```

Follow the Random Walk case study pattern for the Validation Summary table structure. Use qualitative assessments matching the NIST approach -- the NIST beam deflections case study uses graphical assessment for residual validation rather than formal test statistics.

  <action>
Make two changes to beam-deflections.mdx:

**1. Add "## Interpretation" section** between "## Validate New Model" (after the Validation Summary) and "## Conclusions". Follow the Phase 57/59 pattern of 3 paragraphs: overall assessment, model development finding, practical implications.

Insert before `## Conclusions`:

```mdx
## Interpretation

The graphical and quantitative analyses of the original beam deflection data reveal a clear pattern: while the [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) shows stable location and variation (confirmed by the location test with <InlineMath tex="t = 0.022" /> and [Levene test](/eda/quantitative/levene-test/) with <InlineMath tex="W = 0.09378" />), the randomness assumption is severely violated. The [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/) displays an elliptical structure indicating strong positive autocorrelation, the [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) confirms significant dependence at multiple lags with a periodic decay pattern, and the [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) identifies the dominant frequency at approximately <InlineMath tex="0.3" /> cycles per observation. Because randomness is violated, the distribution and outlier tests are not meaningful, and the simple univariate model <InlineMath tex="Y_i = C + E_i" /> is rejected.

The sinusoidal model <InlineMath tex="Y_i = C + \alpha\sin(2\pi\omega t_i + \phi) + E_i" /> captures the periodic structure with highly significant parameter estimates: constant <InlineMath tex="C = -178.786" />, amplitude <InlineMath tex="\alpha = -361.766" />, frequency <InlineMath tex="\omega = 0.302596" />, and phase <InlineMath tex="\phi = 1.46536" />. The model achieves a 44% reduction in residual standard deviation (from <InlineMath tex="277.3" /> to <InlineMath tex="155.8" />), and the residual diagnostics confirm that all four assumptions are now satisfied: the residual [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) shows no systematic pattern, the residual [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/) shows a structureless cloud, and the residual [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) falls within the 95% confidence bands. The [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/) of residuals is approximately linear with a minor left-tail departure.

The practical implication is significant: the standard confidence interval <InlineMath tex="\bar{Y} \pm 2s/\sqrt{N}" /> computed from the original data is invalid because the randomness violation inflates the effective sample size. After fitting the sinusoidal model, the residuals satisfy the independence assumption, and valid confidence intervals can be constructed using the residual standard deviation of <InlineMath tex="155.8" /> rather than the inflated <InlineMath tex="277.3" />. This case study demonstrates that the [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) and [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) are indispensable for detecting periodic structure that is invisible to location and variation diagnostics.
```

**2. Update "## Conclusions"** to reference model parameter values and validation results. Replace the existing Conclusions content (lines 248-250 approximately) with:

```mdx
## Conclusions

Two of four assumptions hold for the original data: fixed location and fixed variation. The randomness assumption is severely violated -- the [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) and [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) reveal significant periodic (sinusoidal) structure with a dominant frequency near <InlineMath tex="0.3" /> cycles per observation. Because randomness fails, distributional testing is not meaningful, and the univariate model <InlineMath tex="Y_i = C + E_i" /> is not appropriate.

The sinusoidal model with parameters <InlineMath tex="C = -178.786" />, <InlineMath tex="\alpha = -361.766" />, <InlineMath tex="\omega = 0.302596" />, and <InlineMath tex="\phi = 1.46536" /> captures the periodic structure, reducing the residual standard deviation by 44%. Residual diagnostics confirm that all four assumptions are satisfied for the model residuals, validating the sinusoidal fit. This case study demonstrates that summary statistics and distributional plots can appear perfectly acceptable while masking serious departures from the independence assumption, making the [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/) and [spectral analysis](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) indispensable tools in any thorough EDA analysis.

**Important notes:**
- Use `<InlineMath tex="..." />` for all statistical values and formulas.
- Cross-reference links must use correct URLs from url-cross-reference.md: `/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/`, `/eda/techniques/lag-plot/`, `/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/`, `/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/`, `/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/`, `/eda/quantitative/levene-test/`.
- The Interpretation section synthesizes -- it should NOT simply restate individual test results but tie them together into a narrative about what the analysis reveals and why it matters.
- Follow the Phase 57 decision: "Interpretation section synthesizes discrete-data artifacts rather than simply restating test results."
