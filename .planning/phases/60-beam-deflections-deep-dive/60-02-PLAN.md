<objective>
Expand the "Develop a Better Model" section in beam-deflections.mdx with NIST regression parameter estimates, model fitting narrative, and residual standard deviation comparison.

Purpose: BEAM-03 requires model fitting details with regression parameter estimates matching NIST values. The current section has the model equation but no parameter table, no standard errors, no t-values, and no residual SD comparison. This plan completes the model development narrative.

Output: Expanded "Develop a Better Model" section with spectral frequency identification narrative, NIST regression parameter table (C, AMP, FREQ, PHASE with SEs and t-values), residual SD comparison, and methodology description.

  <name>Task 1: Expand "Develop a Better Model" with NIST regression parameters</name>
  <files>src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/beam-deflections.mdx</files>
  <action>
Expand the "## Develop a Better Model" section (currently lines 199-207 in the MDX). Keep the existing opening paragraph and model equation. After the model equation and the closing paragraph about fitting, add the following content:

**1. Add spectral frequency identification paragraph** after the existing closing paragraph ("where f ~= 0.3025..."):

After the existing paragraph that ends with "...should satisfy all four assumptions if the sinusoidal component has been successfully removed." add:

```mdx
The dominant frequency <InlineMath tex="f \approx 0.3025" /> was determined from the [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/), which shows a single prominent peak. NIST used [complex demodulation](/eda/techniques/complex-demodulation/) to refine the starting frequency estimate before applying nonlinear least squares regression to fit the four-parameter sinusoidal model simultaneously.
```

**2. Add "### Model Parameters" subsection** after the spectral frequency paragraph:

```mdx
### Model Parameters

The nonlinear regression produces the following parameter estimates:

| Parameter | Estimate | Std Error | t-Value |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| <InlineMath tex="C" /> (constant) | <InlineMath tex="-178.786" /> | 11.02 | <InlineMath tex="-16.22" /> |
| <InlineMath tex="\alpha" /> (amplitude) | <InlineMath tex="-361.766" /> | 26.19 | <InlineMath tex="-13.81" /> |
| <InlineMath tex="\omega" /> (frequency) | <InlineMath tex="0.302596" /> | 0.0001510 | <InlineMath tex="2005" /> |
| <InlineMath tex="\phi" /> (phase) | <InlineMath tex="1.46536" /> | 0.04909 | <InlineMath tex="29.85" /> |

Residual standard deviation: <InlineMath tex="s_e = 155.8484" /> with 196 degrees of freedom.

All four parameters are highly significant. The frequency t-value of <InlineMath tex="2005" /> reflects the fact that the sinusoidal period is very precisely determined by the 200 observations. The residual standard deviation of <InlineMath tex="155.8" /> represents a **44% reduction** from the original data's standard deviation of <InlineMath tex="277.3" />, confirming that the sinusoidal model captures a substantial portion of the data's variability.

NIST notes that three potential outliers are present in the residuals and that removing them would reduce the residual standard deviation by approximately 5% (from 155.8 to 148.3). However, they conclude that retaining or removing the outliers is "a judgment call" -- the full-data fit is presented here as the primary result.
```

**Important notes:**
- Use `<InlineMath tex="..." />` for ALL statistical values (it is already imported).
- The NIST parameter values are: C = -178.786, AMP = -361.766, FREQ = 0.302596, PHASE = 1.46536.
- Standard errors: SE(C) = 11.02, SE(AMP) = 26.19, SE(FREQ) = 0.0001510, SE(PHASE) = 0.04909.
- t-values: t(C) = -16.22, t(AMP) = -13.81, t(FREQ) = 2005, t(PHASE) = 29.85.
- Residual SD = 155.8484 with 196 df (n=200, 4 parameters).
- Original data SD = 277.332 (from the Summary Statistics table already in the MDX).
- Do NOT modify the sinusoidal model computation in BeamDeflectionPlots.astro -- the component's linearized OLS is mathematically equivalent for residual computation. The MDX presents the NIST nonlinear regression parameterization.
- Follow the Random Walk pattern: parameter table, then residual SD comparison paragraph, then additional context (outliers note).
