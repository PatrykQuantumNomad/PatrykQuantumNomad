<current_state>
Executing Phase 50 (SVG Generator Library) via /gsd:execute-phase 50.
Wave 1 (Plan 50-01) is COMPLETE. Wave 2 (Plan 50-02) and Wave 3 (Plan 50-03) remain.
Context window ran out mid-execution. All plans are written and verified — just need to spawn executors for the remaining 2 waves.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Plan 50-01 (Wave 1): COMPLETE — 3 commits (f7d3002, 470b4e8, 2a33903)
  - plot-base.ts: PALETTE, PlotConfig, DEFAULT_CONFIG, svgOpen, innerDimensions, xAxis, yAxis, gridLinesH, gridLinesV, titleText
  - statistics.ts: mean, standardDeviation, kde, silvermanBandwidth, linearRegression, normalQuantile, autocorrelation, fft, powerSpectrum
  - global.css: html.dark CSS variable overrides for dark mode
  - histogram.ts: generateHistogram with KDE overlay (14,565 chars output)
  - box-plot.ts: generateBoxPlot with quartiles, whiskers, outliers (5,579 chars output)
  - bar-plot.ts: generateBarPlot with grouped bars and error bars (3,455 chars output)
  - Requirements completed: SVG-01, SVG-02, SVG-03, SVG-07, SVG-12, SVG-13
  - SUMMARY: .planning/phases/50-svg-generator-library/50-01-SUMMARY.md
  - STATE.md updated to reflect 50-01 completion

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Plan 50-02 (Wave 2): NOT STARTED — scatter, line, lag, probability, spectral, star plot generators
  - Files: scatter-plot.ts, line-plot.ts, lag-plot.ts, probability-plot.ts, spectral-plot.ts, star-plot.ts
  - Requirements: SVG-04, SVG-05, SVG-06, SVG-09, SVG-14, SVG-15
  - Depends on: 50-01 (DONE)
  - autonomous: true

- Plan 50-03 (Wave 3): NOT STARTED — contour plot, distribution curves, composite 4/6-plot, barrel export
  - Files: contour-plot.ts, distribution-curve.ts, composite-plot.ts, index.ts, datasets.ts, package.json
  - Requirements: SVG-08, SVG-10, SVG-11
  - Depends on: 50-01 and 50-02
  - autonomous: true
  - NOTE: d3-contour needs to be installed (npm install d3-contour@^4.0.2)
  - NOTE: Contour plot uses PALETTE CSS vars with opacity-based quantization (NOT hardcoded hex — this was a blocker caught during plan verification)

- After all 3 waves: gsd-verifier needs to run to verify phase goal achievement

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- PALETTE uses CSS custom property references for automatic dark/light theme support (confirmed 50-01)
- Dark mode CSS overrides added to global.css now, not deferred to Phase 55 (confirmed 50-01)
- statistics.ts is pure TypeScript math (~200 lines), no library dependencies (confirmed 50-01)
- All SVG coordinate values use .toFixed(2) to prevent markup bloat (confirmed 50-01)
- Contour plot fills use PALETTE CSS variables with opacity quantization, NOT hardcoded hex colors (plan revision after checker caught SVG-13 violation)
- d3-interpolate NOT needed (removed during plan revision)
- Star plot reuses existing radar-math.ts polarToCartesian (import, not duplicate)
- 6 distribution math functions (normal, exponential, chi-square, uniform, t, gamma) — exceeds 3 required by success criteria

</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. All plans are written and verified. Just need execution time.
</blockers>

<context>
This is a 3-wave sequential execution. Wave 1 established the foundation (plot-base + statistics + 3 generators). Waves 2 and 3 build on that foundation. All plans have passed the plan-checker verification loop (1 blocker was found and fixed: contour plot hardcoded hex colors replaced with PALETTE CSS vars). The execution pattern is: spawn gsd-executor for each plan, spot-check results, then next wave. After all 3 waves, spawn gsd-verifier.
</context>

<next_action>
Resume with `/gsd:execute-phase 50` — it will detect 50-01 SUMMARY exists, skip it, and continue from Wave 2 (Plan 50-02).

Alternatively, manually continue the execute-phase workflow:
1. Read 50-02-PLAN.md and STATE.md
2. Spawn gsd-executor for Plan 50-02 (model: opus)
3. Spot-check results (files exist, commits present, no FAILED marker)
4. Read 50-03-PLAN.md
5. Spawn gsd-executor for Plan 50-03 (model: opus)
6. Spot-check results
7. Spawn gsd-verifier (model: sonnet) to verify phase goal
8. Update ROADMAP.md and STATE.md
9. Offer next: /gsd:plan-phase 51
