<objective>
Replace the placeholder home page with a complete hero section featuring a CSS typing animation, CTA buttons, professional summary, tech skills, and latest blog posts.

Purpose: The home page is the primary landing page and must make a strong first impression on recruiters, collaborators, and the developer community. The typing animation and structured content showcase both personality and technical breadth.

Output: A fully responsive home page at / with animated hero, CTAs, skills section, and latest posts.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build complete home page with hero, typing animation, and content sections</name>
  <files>src/pages/index.astro</files>
  <action>
Replace the placeholder content in src/pages/index.astro with a complete home page. The page structure from top to bottom:

**1. Hero Section (full-width, prominent)**
- Large heading: "Patryk Golabek"
- Subheading with CSS typing animation cycling through roles: "Cloud-Native Architect", "Kubernetes Pioneer", "AI/ML Engineer", "Platform Builder". The animation should use CSS keyframes only (no JS library). Use a `@keyframes typing` animation with `steps()` and a blinking cursor via `border-right` on a span. Cycle through roles by using multiple animation phases with `@keyframes rotate-text` that changes `content` via CSS or by stacking spans with `opacity` animation offsets. Simplest reliable approach: use a single visible span with a `typing` class that has the text set in a CSS custom property, then use a `<script is:inline>` block (small, ~15 lines) to rotate the text content every 3 seconds. The cursor blinks via pure CSS `@keyframes blink`.
- Brief tagline: "Building resilient cloud-native systems and AI-powered solutions for 17+ years. Pre-1.0 Kubernetes adopter. Ontario, Canada."
- Two CTA buttons: "View Projects" linking to /projects/ (primary, accent background) and "Read Blog" linking to /blog/ (secondary, outlined)

**2. Skills/Expertise Section**
- Section heading: "What I Build"
- Grid of 4 category cards (2 cols on sm, 4 on lg), each with an icon (use inline SVG), title, and brief description:
  - **Cloud-Native & Kubernetes**: "Designing and operating production Kubernetes clusters since pre-1.0. Service meshes, GitOps, observability stacks."
  - **AI/ML Systems**: "Building LLM agents, RAG pipelines, and intelligent automation with LangGraph, Langflow, and custom orchestration."
  - **Platform Engineering**: "Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Terragrunt. CI/CD pipelines, DevSecOps, and developer experience."
  - **Full-Stack Development**: "Python, Java, TypeScript. React, Angular, Next.js. APIs, microservices, and data pipelines."

**3. Latest Blog Posts Section**
- Section heading: "Latest Writing"
- Import `getCollection` from `astro:content` and fetch the 3 most recent non-draft posts (same pattern as blog/index.astro)
- Display each post as a compact card: title (linked to /blog/{post.id}/), date, description. Use simpler styling than BlogCard -- just title as a link, date below, one-line description. Do NOT import BlogCard component (keep it lightweight and home-page specific).
- "View all posts" link at the bottom pointing to /blog/

**4. Contact CTA Section (bottom)**
- Brief text: "Interested in working together?"
- Two links: "Get in Touch" (mailto:patryk@translucentcomputing.com) and "Connect on LinkedIn" (https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrykgolabek/)

**Styling rules:**
- Use `var(--color-*)` CSS custom properties for ALL colors (not Tailwind dark: variants)
- Container: `max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8` for each section
- Hero section gets extra vertical padding: `py-20 sm:py-28`
- Other sections: `py-16`
- Skills cards: `p-6 rounded-lg border border-[var(--color-border)] bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)]`
- Primary CTA button: `inline-flex items-center px-6 py-3 rounded-lg bg-[var(--color-accent)] text-white font-medium hover:bg-[var(--color-accent-hover)] transition-colors`
- Secondary CTA button: `inline-flex items-center px-6 py-3 rounded-lg border border-[var(--color-accent)] text-[var(--color-accent)] font-medium hover:bg-[var(--color-accent)]/10 transition-colors`
- Section headings: `text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-heading font-bold mb-8`

**Typing animation CSS (add in a `<style>` block in the component):**
```css
.typing-cursor::after {
  content: '|';
  animation: blink 0.8s step-end infinite;
  color: var(--color-accent);
}
@keyframes blink {
  50% { opacity: 0; }
}
```

**Typing rotation script (add as `<script is:inline>`):**
```javascript
(function() {
  const roles = ['Cloud-Native Architect', 'Kubernetes Pioneer', 'AI/ML Engineer', 'Platform Builder'];
  let i = 0;
  const el = document.getElementById('typing-role');
  if (el) {
    setInterval(() => {
      i = (i + 1) % roles.length;
      el.textContent = roles[i];
    }, 3000);
  }
})();
```

The typing-role span should have `id="typing-role"` and class `typing-cursor` and display the first role as initial text content.

Layout title: "Patryk Golabek — Cloud-Native Software Architect | Portfolio"
Layout description: "Portfolio of Patryk Golabek, a Cloud-Native Software Architect with 17+ years building Kubernetes, AI/ML, and platform engineering solutions."
