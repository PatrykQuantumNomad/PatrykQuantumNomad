<objective>
Create the Projects page (all 19 GitHub repos grouped by category), About page (professional bio and tech stack), and Contact page (email and LinkedIn links).

Purpose: These three pages complete the 5-page site structure. The Projects page is the primary showcase of technical breadth. The About page provides recruiter-friendly professional context. The Contact page provides clear ways to reach Patryk.

Output: Three new pages at /projects/, /about/, and /contact/ plus a typed project data file.

  <name>Task 1: Create project data file and Projects page</name>
  <files>src/data/projects.ts, src/pages/projects/index.astro</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Create src/data/projects.ts**

Define a TypeScript interface and export the project data:

```typescript
export interface Project {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  url: string;
  language: string;
  category: string;
}

export const categories = [
  'AI/ML & LLM Agents',
  'Kubernetes & Infrastructure',
  'Platform & DevOps Tooling',
  'Full-Stack Applications',
  'Security & Networking',
] as const;

export type Category = typeof categories[number];
```

Export a `projects` array with all 19 repos (excluding the PatrykQuantumNomad profile repo since it IS this site). 18 original repos + 1 fork = 19 total. Include the profile repo but mark it distinctly. Actually, include all 19 repos. Categorize as follows:

**AI/ML & LLM Agents:**

- `arjancode_examples` — "Code examples and patterns from software architecture video series" (fork)

**Security & Networking:**
- `networking-tools` — "Network scanning, penetration testing, and security audit toolkit" (Shell)

**Step 2: Create src/pages/projects/index.astro**

Import projects and categories from the data file. Group projects by category. Render:

- Page heading: "Projects"
- Subheading: "Open-source work spanning Kubernetes, AI/ML, infrastructure as code, and platform engineering. All repositories live on GitHub."
- For each category (in the order defined in `categories`):
  - Category heading (h2): category name
  - Grid of project cards (1 col on mobile, 2 cols on md, 3 cols on lg): `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4`
  - Each project card: `p-5 rounded-lg border border-[var(--color-border)] bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] hover:border-[var(--color-accent)] transition-colors`
    - Project name as a link to the GitHub repo URL (opens in new tab): `<a href={project.url} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`
    - Name styled: `font-heading font-bold text-lg group-hover:text-[var(--color-accent)]` (wrap card in `group` class)
    - Language badge: small pill showing the language, e.g. `<span class="text-xs px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full bg-[var(--color-accent)]/10 text-[var(--color-accent)]">{project.language}</span>`
    - Description: `text-sm text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] mt-2`
    - External link icon (small SVG arrow) next to the project name to indicate it opens externally
  - If a project is a fork (arjancode_examples), add a small "Fork" badge next to language

- Bottom section: link to full GitHub profile "View all repositories on GitHub" pointing to https://github.com/PatrykQuantumNomad

Container: `max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16`
Section spacing between categories: `mt-12` (except first)

  <name>Task 2: Create About page and Contact page</name>
  <files>src/pages/about.astro, src/pages/contact.astro</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Create src/pages/about.astro**

A professional About page with these sections:

**1. Introduction**
- Heading: "About Me"
- Professional photo placeholder: a styled div with initials "PG" (same pattern as header logo but larger, e.g., `w-24 h-24 rounded-full bg-[var(--color-accent)] flex items-center justify-center text-white text-3xl font-heading font-bold`). Float or position it nicely alongside the intro text on desktop.
- Bio paragraph (2-3 paragraphs): Write in first person, professional but approachable tone. Cover:
  - "I'm Patryk Golabek, a Cloud-Native Software Architect based in Ontario, Canada, with over 17 years of experience building and scaling production systems."
  - "I've been working with Kubernetes since before its 1.0 release, and my career has spanned the full evolution of cloud computing — from early containerization through today's AI-powered platforms. I specialize in designing resilient distributed systems, building AI/ML pipelines, and creating the developer platforms that teams need to ship with confidence."
  - "When I'm not architecting cloud infrastructure, I write about what I learn at Translucent Computing and Kubert AI — sharing practical insights on Kubernetes, observability, LLM agents, and platform engineering."

**2. Tech Stack Section**
- Heading: "Tech Stack"
- Organized as a grid of category groups. Each group has a label and a list of tech badges. Use `flex flex-wrap gap-2` for badges within each group. Badge style: `text-sm px-3 py-1 rounded-full bg-[var(--color-surface-alt)] border border-[var(--color-border)] text-[var(--color-text-primary)]`
  - **Languages:** Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Shell, SQL, HCL
  - **Frontend:** React, Angular, Next.js, Astro, Tailwind CSS
  - **Backend:** Node.js, FastAPI, Spring Boot, REST, GraphQL
  - **Cloud & Infra:** Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Terragrunt, Helm, Google Cloud, AWS
  - **AI/ML:** LangGraph, Langflow, LLM Agents, RAG Pipelines, Prompt Engineering, Gemini, OpenAI
  - **DevOps:** CI/CD, GitOps, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, Observability, Prometheus, Grafana

**3. Career Highlights**
- Heading: "Career Highlights"
- A vertical timeline or highlight list (not a full resume). 4-5 key points with brief descriptions. Use a left-border accent style:
  - "Pre-1.0 Kubernetes Adopter" — "Started building production Kubernetes clusters before the 1.0 release, contributing to the ecosystem from its earliest days."
  - "Cloud-Native Architecture Leadership" — "Designed and delivered cloud-native platforms handling production workloads across Google Cloud and AWS."
  - "AI/ML Systems Builder" — "Building LLM agent systems, RAG pipelines, and AI-powered automation using LangGraph and custom orchestration."
  - "Open-Source Contributor" — "Maintaining 19+ repositories spanning Kubernetes tooling, AI agents, infrastructure as code, and developer platforms."
  - "Technical Writer" — "Publishing regularly at Translucent Computing and Kubert AI on cloud architecture, Kubernetes, and AI engineering."

**4. Connect Section (bottom)**
- Heading: "Let's Connect"
- Links: GitHub, LinkedIn, Translucent Computing Blog, Kubert AI Blog, Email
- Each as an inline flex item with an icon and label

Container: `max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16` (narrower max-w for readability)
Layout title: "About — Patryk Golabek"
Layout description: "About Patryk Golabek — Cloud-Native Software Architect with 17+ years of experience in Kubernetes, AI/ML, platform engineering, and full-stack development."

**Step 2: Create src/pages/contact.astro**

A simple, focused Contact page:

- Heading: "Get in Touch"
- Brief text: "I'm always interested in discussing cloud-native architecture, AI/ML systems, and platform engineering opportunities. Feel free to reach out."
- Two prominent contact cards side by side (1 col on mobile, 2 on sm+):
  - **Email card:** envelope SVG icon, "Email" label, `patryk@translucentcomputing.com` as a clickable mailto link. Card style same as project cards.
  - **LinkedIn card:** LinkedIn SVG icon, "LinkedIn" label, "Connect on LinkedIn" as a clickable link to https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrykgolabek/. Card style same.
- Below cards, a smaller "Other places to find me" section with links to: GitHub profile, Translucent Computing blog, Kubert AI blog

Container: `max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16`
Layout title: "Contact — Patryk Golabek"
