<objective>
Add Interpretation sections to the Normal Random Numbers and Heat Flow Meter case studies, bringing both to full NIST parity.

Purpose: These two case studies already have complete plot subsections, quantitative results, and conclusions. The only gap is the missing "## Interpretation" section that synthesizes graphical and quantitative evidence. This plan also verifies all test statistic values and resolves the Heat Flow Meter PPCC discrepancy (MDX says 0.996, NIST says 0.999).

Output: Two fully complete case study MDX files matching the canonical template structure.

  <name>Task 1: Add Interpretation section to Normal Random Numbers and verify values</name>
  <files>src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/normal-random-numbers.mdx</files>
  <action>
1. **Verify all test statistic values** match NIST source data by reading the existing MDX and cross-referencing against Phase 56 validated values (from 56-01-SUMMARY.md):
   - Location test: t = -0.1251 (NIST: slope not significant) -- MUST match
   - Bartlett's test: T = 2.3737 (NIST: no significant change) -- MUST match
   - Runs test: Z = -1.0744 (NIST: consistent with random) -- MUST match
   - Lag-1 autocorrelation: r1 = 0.045 (NIST: 0.04) -- acceptable rounding
   - Anderson-Darling: A^2 = 1.0612 (NIST: reject at 5%) -- MUST match
   - PPCC: 0.996 (NIST: 0.996) -- MUST match
   - Grubbs: G = 3.3681 (NIST: no outliers) -- MUST match

2. **Add ## Interpretation section** between the "### Test Summary" subsection (under Quantitative Output and Interpretation) and "## Conclusions". The section should be 2-3 paragraphs synthesizing:
   - Paragraph 1: Overall assessment -- all four assumptions pass. Cite specific test statistics: location (t = -0.1251), variation (Bartlett T = 2.3737), randomness (runs Z = -1.0744, r1 = 0.045). Reference the [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) and [lag plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/).
   - Paragraph 2: Address the marginal normality rejection. Anderson-Darling (A^2 = 1.0612) rejects at 5%, but the [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/) shows excellent linearity. Explain this is a power artifact at n = 500 -- the test detects trivially small departures. PPCC (0.996) and Grubbs (G = 3.3681, no outliers) confirm the data are well-behaved.
   - Paragraph 3: Practical conclusion -- the univariate model Y_i = C + E_i is appropriate. The standard 95% confidence interval is valid because all four assumptions hold. Cross-reference technique pages using InlineMath for formulas and markdown links.

3. **Use InlineMath for all formulas** -- e.g., `<InlineMath tex="t = -0.1251" />`, not raw text.

4. **Use cross-reference links** from the url-cross-reference.md cheat sheet for technique and quantitative method page links.

5. **Do NOT modify any other sections** -- the existing Background, Goals, Graphical Output, Quantitative Output, and Conclusions are already complete and correct.

Run `npx astro check 2>&1 | tail -20` to verify zero TypeScript/Astro errors. Then run `grep -n "## Interpretation" src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/normal-random-numbers.mdx` to confirm the section exists.

  <name>Task 2: Add Interpretation section to Heat Flow Meter, resolve PPCC discrepancy, and verify values</name>
  <files>src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/heat-flow-meter.mdx</files>
  <action>
1. **Resolve PPCC discrepancy** -- The MDX currently says PPCC = 0.996 but NIST says 0.999. Compute the actual value:
   - Import the heat flow meter dataset from datasets.ts
   - Call `ppccNormal(timeSeries)` from statistics.ts in a quick check (or read the test file to find the validated value)
   - The Phase 56 test suite validated ppccNormal for normalRandom (0.996) and other datasets but the HFM PPCC may not have been in the test suite. If the computed value is 0.999, update the MDX. If it is 0.996, keep the MDX value and note that the statistics.ts function was validated against NIST.
   - Check the Distribution Test section and Test Summary table for consistency with whichever PPCC value is correct.

2. **Verify all other test statistic values** match NIST:
   - Location test: t = -1.960 (NIST: slope essentially zero) -- MUST match
   - Bartlett's test: T = 3.147 (NIST: no significant change) -- MUST match
   - Runs test: Z = -3.2306 (NIST: significant) -- MUST match
   - Lag-1 autocorrelation: r1 = 0.281 (NIST: 0.28) -- acceptable rounding
   - Anderson-Darling: A^2 = 0.129 (NIST: cannot reject normality) -- MUST match
   - Grubbs: G = 2.918673 (NIST: no outliers) -- MUST match
   - Mean: 9.261460, Std Dev: 0.022789 (NIST: 9.261, 0.023) -- acceptable rounding

3. **Add ## Interpretation section** between the "### Test Summary" subsection and "## Conclusions". Write 2-3 paragraphs:
   - Paragraph 1: Overall assessment -- location, variation, and normality assumptions all pass. The only violation is mild non-randomness. Cite specific numbers: location (t = -1.960, borderline but drift negligible), variation (Bartlett T = 3.147, well below 7.815), normality (A^2 = 0.129, well below 0.787). Reference graphical evidence: [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) shows stable process, [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/) is linear.
   - Paragraph 2: Address the randomness violation. Runs test (Z = -3.231) and lag-1 autocorrelation (r1 = 0.281) both reject independence, but the violation is mild. The autocorrelation decays quickly (visible in the [autocorrelation plot](/eda/techniques/autocorrelation-plot/)). The [spectral plot](/eda/techniques/spectral-plot/) shows no periodic structure. Reference NIST's own conclusion that the departure "is not serious enough to warrant developing a more sophisticated model."
   - Paragraph 3: Practical conclusion -- the univariate model Y_i = 9.26146 + E_i is appropriate. The standard confidence interval is approximately valid, though the true uncertainty is somewhat larger due to mild autocorrelation. The process is considered to be in statistical control.

4. **Use InlineMath for all formulas** and **cross-reference links** from url-cross-reference.md.

5. **Do NOT modify any other sections** except the PPCC value correction if needed (in Distribution Test section and Test Summary table).
