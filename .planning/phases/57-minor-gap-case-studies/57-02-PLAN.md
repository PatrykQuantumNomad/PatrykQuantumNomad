<objective>
Fix heading structure and add Interpretation section to the Cryothermometry case study, bringing it to full NIST parity.

Purpose: The Cryothermometry case study already has complete content (all 7 plot subsections, full quantitative results with test summary). Two gaps remain: (1) the section heading "## Quantitative Results" should be the canonical "## Quantitative Output and Interpretation", and (2) a "## Interpretation" section is missing that synthesizes the graphical and quantitative evidence about the discrete-data artifacts and mild assumption violations.

Output: Cryothermometry MDX file with canonical heading structure and complete Interpretation section.

  <name>Task 1: Fix heading structure in Cryothermometry</name>

  <action>
1. **Rename section heading** -- Change `## Quantitative Results` to `## Quantitative Output and Interpretation` to match the canonical template.

2. **Verify Graphical Output parent heading** -- Check that the file has `## Graphical Output and Interpretation` as a parent heading and that `### 4-Plot Overview` is nested under it. Currently the file structure should be:
   - `## Graphical Output and Interpretation` (if missing, it needs to be added before `### 4-Plot Overview`)
   - Followed by `### 4-Plot Overview`, `### Run Sequence Plot`, etc.

   Read the current file carefully. If `### 4-Plot Overview` appears before any `## Graphical Output and Interpretation` heading, the `## Graphical Output and Interpretation` section intro paragraph needs to be added and the 4-Plot subsection placed under it.

   Looking at the current file: The content after "### Goals" goes directly to "### 4-Plot Overview" without a "## Graphical Output and Interpretation" parent heading. This needs to be fixed:
   - Add `## Graphical Output and Interpretation` with a brief intro paragraph AFTER the Goals section and BEFORE `### 4-Plot Overview`
   - The intro paragraph should be: "The graphical analysis uses the standard suite of EDA plots to assess the four underlying assumptions. The discrete integer nature of the cryothermometry data creates visual artifacts in several plots that must be interpreted carefully."

3. **Do NOT modify** any content within existing subsections -- only fix headings and structure.

  <verify>
Run `grep -n "^## " src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/cryothermometry.mdx` to verify the h2 heading structure matches the canonical template: Background and Data, Test Underlying Assumptions, Graphical Output and Interpretation, Quantitative Output and Interpretation, Conclusions.
  </verify>
  <done>
Cryothermometry uses canonical headings: "## Graphical Output and Interpretation" parent heading present with 4-Plot Overview nested under it, and "## Quantitative Output and Interpretation" (not "## Quantitative Results"). Heading structure matches the canonical case-study-template.md.

  <name>Task 2: Add Interpretation section to Cryothermometry and verify values</name>
  <files>src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/cryothermometry.mdx</files>
  <action>
1. **Verify all test statistic values** match NIST source data:
   - Location test: t = 4.445 (NIST: slope near zero, statistically significant but practically negligible) -- MUST match
   - Levene test: W = 1.43 (NIST: no significant drift in variation) -- MUST match
   - Runs test: Z = -13.4162 (NIST: not random) -- MUST match
   - Lag-1 autocorrelation: r1 = 0.31 (NIST: 0.31) -- MUST match
   - Anderson-Darling: A^2 = 16.858 (NIST: reject normality) -- MUST match
   - PPCC: 0.975 (NIST: 0.975, reject) -- MUST match
   - Grubbs: G = 2.729 (NIST: no outliers) -- MUST match
   - Mean: 2898.562, Std Dev: 1.305 (NIST: 2898.56, 1.30) -- acceptable rounding

2. **Add ## Interpretation section** between the "### Test Summary" subsection and "## Conclusions". Write 2-3 paragraphs:
   - Paragraph 1: Overall assessment. The variation assumption is cleanly satisfied (Levene W = 1.43). Location shows a statistically significant but practically negligible drift (t = 4.445, but slope of 0.001071 means only 0.75 counts over 700 observations). No outliers (Grubbs G = 2.729). The key violations are in randomness and normality. Reference the [run sequence plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) for stable location and the [Levene test](/eda/quantitative/levene-test/) for constant variation.
   - Paragraph 2: The randomness and normality violations need careful interpretation in context of the discrete integer data. The [runs test](/eda/quantitative/runs-test/) (Z = -13.4162) and lag-1 autocorrelation (r1 = 0.31) reject independence, but integer-valued data with only ~8 distinct values naturally creates long runs of identical readings, inflating autocorrelation. Similarly, the [Anderson-Darling test](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/) (A^2 = 16.858) and PPCC (0.975) reject normality, but integer data cannot be perfectly normal -- the staircase [normal probability plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/) is a measurement artifact. The discrete nature of the data accounts for much of the violation.
   - Paragraph 3: Practical conclusion. Despite the statistical rejections, the violations are mild and largely attributable to measurement discreteness rather than genuine process deficiencies. The univariate model Y_i = 2898.562 + E_i remains appropriate. The standard confidence interval is approximately valid, though the mild autocorrelation means the effective sample size is smaller than 700 and the true interval is somewhat wider.

3. **Use InlineMath for all formulas** and **cross-reference links** from url-cross-reference.md.

  <verify>
Run `npx astro check 2>&1 | tail -20` to verify zero errors. Then run `grep -n "## Interpretation" src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/cryothermometry.mdx` to confirm the section exists. Then verify section order: `grep -n "^## " src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/cryothermometry.mdx` should show: Background and Data, Test Underlying Assumptions, Graphical Output and Interpretation, Quantitative Output and Interpretation, Interpretation, Conclusions.
  </verify>
  <done>
Cryothermometry MDX has a "## Interpretation" section between Quantitative Output and Interpretation and Conclusions that synthesizes evidence about discrete-data artifacts and mild assumption violations with specific test statistics cited via InlineMath. All test statistic values verified against NIST. `npx astro check` reports 0 errors.
