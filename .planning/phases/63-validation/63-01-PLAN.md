<objective>
Verify cross-reference link integrity and statistical accuracy across all 9 enhanced case studies.

Purpose: Ensure zero broken links and zero statistical discrepancies before final build validation. This is the comprehensive audit that validates all content added/modified by phases 57-62.
Output: All 9 case study MDX files verified (and corrected if needed) for link integrity and NIST statistical accuracy.

    Extract ALL internal links from all 9 enhanced case study MDX files and validate every link resolves to a real route.

    Step 1 - Extract all unique links from each file:
    ```bash
    rg -o '\(/eda/[^)]+\)' src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/{normal-random-numbers,uniform-random-numbers,cryothermometry,beam-deflections,filter-transmittance,standard-resistor,heat-flow-meter,fatigue-life,ceramic-strength}.mdx
    ```

    Step 2 - Build the valid slug inventories:
    - Technique slugs: Extract all "id" values from `src/data/eda/techniques.json` (47 entries: 29 graphical + 18 quantitative). Technique links use `/eda/techniques/{slug}/` for graphical and `/eda/quantitative/{slug}/` for quantitative.
    - Distribution slugs: Extract all "id" values from `src/data/eda/distributions.json` (19 entries). Links use `/eda/distributions/{slug}/`.
    - Case study slugs: List filenames in `src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/` (10 files). Links use `/eda/case-studies/{slug}/`.
    - Foundation slugs: List filenames in `src/data/eda/pages/foundations/` (6 files). Links use `/eda/foundations/{slug}/`.
    - Reference slugs: List filenames in `src/data/eda/pages/reference/` (4 files). Links use `/eda/reference/{slug}/`.
    - Index pages: `/eda/`, `/eda/distributions/`, `/eda/techniques/`.

    Step 3 - Compare every extracted link against the valid slug inventories. For each link, verify:
    - The route prefix matches one of the 6 known patterns: `/eda/techniques/`, `/eda/quantitative/`, `/eda/distributions/`, `/eda/case-studies/`, `/eda/foundations/`, `/eda/reference/`
    - The slug portion matches an actual entry in the corresponding data source
    - Anchor fragments (if any, like `#section-name`) are noted but not validated (SSG doesn't validate anchors)

    Step 4 - Also check inter-case-study links specifically. Known inter-case-study links include:
    - Filter Transmittance -> Beam Deflections
    - Heat Flow Meter -> Random Walk
    - Standard Resistor -> Filter Transmittance
    - Normal Random Numbers -> Random Walk
    - Uniform Random Numbers -> Normal Random Numbers
    Verify these resolve (Random Walk is a valid target even though it's not one of the 9 enhanced studies).

    Step 5 - If ANY broken links found, fix them in the MDX files. Use the same fix patterns as Quick Task 011 (slug corrections, category prefix corrections). Document each fix.

    IMPORTANT: Quick Task 011 already fixed 5 broken links on 2026-02-26, but phases 57-62 added substantial new content afterward. Focus validation on the NEW content added by those phases.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run the link extraction command again after any fixes:
    ```bash
    rg -o '\(/eda/[^)]+\)' src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/{normal-random-numbers,uniform-random-numbers,cryothermometry,beam-deflections,filter-transmittance,standard-resistor,heat-flow-meter,fatigue-life,ceramic-strength}.mdx | sort -u
    ```
    Then programmatically verify every extracted link slug exists in the corresponding data source. Zero unresolved links.
  </verify>
  <done>Every internal cross-reference link in all 9 enhanced case study MDX files has been validated against the authoritative slug inventories with zero unresolved links remaining.</done>

    Systematically compare every numerical value in the quantitative results tables of all 9 case studies against the corresponding NIST source pages.

    For each of the 6 STANDARD-TEMPLATE case studies (Normal Random Numbers, Uniform Random Numbers, Cryothermometry, Filter Transmittance, Heat Flow Meter, Standard Resistor):

    1. Read the MDX file's Quantitative Output / Quantitative Results section
    2. Fetch the corresponding NIST page using WebFetch:
       - NRN: https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda4213.htm
       - URN: https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda4223.htm
       - Cryo: https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda4243.htm
       - Filter: https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda4263.htm
       - HFM: https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda4283.htm
       - StdRes: https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda4273.htm
    3. Compare for each case study:
       - Summary statistics: mean, std dev, median, min, max, range, n
       - Location test: t-statistic value, critical value, conclusion (reject/fail-to-reject)
       - Variation test: Bartlett or Levene statistic, critical value, conclusion
       - Randomness tests: runs test Z-statistic, lag-1 autocorrelation r1, critical values
       - Distribution test: Anderson-Darling A2, PPCC, critical values
       - Outlier test: Grubbs G statistic, critical value (if applicable -- Standard Resistor and Filter Transmittance may omit when randomness violated)

    For the 3 COMPLEX case studies:

    **Beam Deflections** (3 NIST pages):
    - Fetch https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda4252.htm (assumptions)
    - Fetch https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda4253.htm (model development)
    - Fetch https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda4254.htm (model validation)
    - Compare: Original data test results, model parameters (C, AMP, FREQ, PHASE), residual diagnostics
    - Verify: C=-178.786, AMP=-361.766, FREQ=0.302596, PHASE=1.46536 match NIST

    **Fatigue Life** (1 NIST page):
    - Fetch https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda4293.htm
    - Compare: Standard test results + distribution fitting (Weibull/gamma parameters if published by NIST)

    **Ceramic Strength** (1 NIST page, DOE format):
    - Fetch https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section4/eda42a3.htm
    - Compare DOE-specific values: Lab ANOVA F=1.837 vs Fcrit=2.082, batch effects, Yates analysis factor rankings, interaction effects
    - Per Phase 62 decision: F=1.837 < Fcrit=2.082 confirms labs homogeneous at alpha=0.05

    CRITICAL - Known intentional corrections (do NOT flag these as errors):
    - Heat Flow Meter PPCC: project uses 0.999 (computed), NIST prints 0.996
    - Filter Transmittance r1: project uses 0.94 (computed 0.9380), NIST prints 0.93
    - Standard Resistor t-critical: ~1.962 for df=998 (correct for this dataset)
    These are documented decisions in STATE.md, not errors.

    If any genuine discrepancies found (not the known corrections above), fix them in the MDX files and document each correction.
