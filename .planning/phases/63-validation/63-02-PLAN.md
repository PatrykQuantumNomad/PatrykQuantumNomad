<objective>
Verify the full Astro site builds successfully with zero errors, confirming all 9 enhanced case studies compile correctly after any fixes from Plan 01. Update requirement tracking to reflect completion.

Purpose: Final build gate ensures no TypeScript errors, broken imports, or SSG failures exist across the entire site including all v1.9 content. Requirement checkbox cleanup closes the tracking loop for v1.9.
Output: Clean build confirmation + updated REQUIREMENTS.md with all v1.9 requirements marked complete.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Full Astro build validation (VAL-02)</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Run both Astro validation commands in sequence to confirm zero errors across the entire site.

    Step 1 - TypeScript and template validation:
    ```bash
    npx astro check
    ```
    This catches: import errors, type mismatches, template syntax issues, missing component props. Expected result: 0 errors (warnings acceptable).

    Step 2 - Full static site generation:
    ```bash
    npx astro build
    ```
    This catches: broken MDX compilation, missing data references, SSG rendering failures, invalid component usage. Expected result: successful completion with all pages generated. Prior Quick Task 011 baseline was ~950 pages; v1.9 added Standard Resistor (1 new page) so expect ~951+ pages.

    If either command reports errors:
    1. Read the error output carefully
    2. Identify the source file and line
    3. Fix the issue (likely an import path, type mismatch, or MDX syntax error)
    4. Re-run the failing command to confirm the fix
    5. Document each fix

    IMPORTANT: If Plan 01 made any MDX corrections (broken links or statistical value fixes), those changes are already on disk. This build validates the state AFTER those corrections.

    ```bash
    npx astro check 2>&1 | tail -5
    npx astro build 2>&1 | tail -10
    ```
    Both commands must complete with 0 errors. Capture the page count from the build output.

  <done>`npx astro check` reports 0 errors and `npx astro build` completes successfully, generating all pages including all 9 enhanced case studies.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes for completed requirements</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
    Update REQUIREMENTS.md to reflect the actual completion status of all v1.9 requirements.

    Step 1 - Fix stale "pending" checkboxes for requirements that are actually implemented (confirmed by Phase 63 research):
    - RSTR-01: Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` (dataset exists in datasets.ts with 1000 values -- verified)
    - RSTR-02: Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` (StandardResistorPlots.astro exists with all 7 plot types -- verified)
    - BEAM-02: Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` (Beam Deflections has full Quantitative Output with Test Summary table -- verified)

    Step 2 - Update the Phase 63 validation requirement checkboxes based on Plan 01 and this plan's results:
    - VAL-01: Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` (cross-reference links verified in Plan 01)
    - VAL-02: Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` (build validation completed in Task 1 above)
    - VAL-03: Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` (statistical values verified in Plan 01)

    Step 3 - Update the tracking table at the bottom of REQUIREMENTS.md:
    - RSTR-01: Status from "Pending" to "Complete"
    - RSTR-02: Status from "Pending" to "Complete"
    - BEAM-02: Status from "Pending" to "Complete"
    - VAL-01: Status from "Pending" to "Complete"
    - VAL-02: Status from "Pending" to "Complete"
    - VAL-03: Status from "Pending" to "Complete"

    Do NOT modify any other requirements or sections in the file.
  </action>
  <verify>
    ```bash
    grep -c '\- \[ \]' .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
    ```
    Verify no v1.9 requirements remain unchecked. The count of unchecked boxes should decrease by exactly 6 compared to before this task.
  </verify>
  <done>REQUIREMENTS.md shows RSTR-01, RSTR-02, BEAM-02 as complete (fixing stale tracking) and VAL-01, VAL-02, VAL-03 as complete (Phase 63 validation done). All v1.9 requirements are marked complete.</done>
</task>

1. `npx astro check` output shows 0 errors
2. `npx astro build` output shows successful completion with page count
3. REQUIREMENTS.md has all 6 requirements (RSTR-01, RSTR-02, BEAM-02, VAL-01, VAL-02, VAL-03) marked with `[x]`
4. No other requirements were accidentally modified
