<objective>
Verify the complete build succeeds and perform UAT on all Phase 47 deliverables: 67 rule pages, tool page SEO, blog post, homepage integration, LLMs.txt, and sitemap inclusion.

Purpose: Final quality gate before marking Phase 47 and v1.7 complete.
Output: Verified build + UAT results.

  <name>Task 1: Full build verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run the complete Astro build and verify:

1. `npm run build` completes without errors
2. Check build output for 67 rule pages: `ls dist/tools/k8s-analyzer/rules/ | wc -l` should show 67 directories
3. Check OG image was generated: `ls dist/open-graph/tools/k8s-analyzer.png` exists
4. Check blog post was built: `ls dist/blog/kubernetes-manifest-best-practices/` exists
5. Check sitemap includes K8s analyzer pages: `grep -c 'k8s-analyzer' dist/sitemap-0.xml` should return a count > 0 (tool page + 67 rule pages = 68+ entries)
6. Check LLMs.txt: `grep 'Kubernetes Manifest Analyzer' dist/llms.txt` should return the entry

If build fails, diagnose and fix the issue. Common failure modes:
- Type errors in new files (run `npx tsc --noEmit` first)
- Missing imports in [code].astro
- MDX compilation errors in blog post
- allDocumentedK8sRules not exporting 67 items
  </action>
  <verify>
`npm run build` exits with code 0. All build artifacts exist as described.

  <done>Full build succeeds with all 67 rule pages, OG image, blog post, and sitemap entries generated.</done>

  <what-built>
Complete Phase 47 deliverables: 67 rule documentation pages at /tools/k8s-analyzer/rules/[code]/, SoftwareApplication JSON-LD on tool page, OG image for social sharing, companion blog post with ~20 rule cross-links, homepage 3-tool card grid, and LLMs.txt integration.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Run `npm run preview` and verify:

1. **Tool page** at http://localhost:4321/tools/k8s-analyzer/:
   - Page renders with the K8s Analyzer React component
   - Aside section shows links to rule documentation and blog post
   - View page source: confirm `<script type="application/ld+json">` contains "SoftwareApplication"
   - View page source: confirm og:image meta tag points to /open-graph/tools/k8s-analyzer.png

2. **Rule pages** -- check a few samples:
   - http://localhost:4321/tools/k8s-analyzer/rules/ka-c001/ (security with PSS Baseline tag + CIS ref)
   - http://localhost:4321/tools/k8s-analyzer/rules/ka-c002/ (security with PSS Restricted tag + CIS ref)
   - http://localhost:4321/tools/k8s-analyzer/rules/ka-s001/ (schema rule)
   - http://localhost:4321/tools/k8s-analyzer/rules/ka-r001/ (reliability rule)
   - http://localhost:4321/tools/k8s-analyzer/rules/ka-x001/ (cross-resource rule)
   - Each page: breadcrumb trail, severity/category badges, explanation, before/after code, related rules, footer links

3. **Blog post** at http://localhost:4321/blog/kubernetes-manifest-best-practices/:
   - Post renders with correct formatting
   - ~20 rule links are clickable and navigate to correct rule pages
   - Tool page link works

4. **Homepage** at http://localhost:4321/:
   - Tools section shows 3 cards in a responsive grid
   - K8s Manifest Analyzer card links to /tools/k8s-analyzer/

5. **OG image** at http://localhost:4321/open-graph/tools/k8s-analyzer.png:
   - Image renders (1200x630) with K8s-themed content

6. **LLMs.txt** at http://localhost:4321/llms.txt:
   - Contains "Kubernetes Manifest Analyzer" entry with URL, Rules, Blog fields
