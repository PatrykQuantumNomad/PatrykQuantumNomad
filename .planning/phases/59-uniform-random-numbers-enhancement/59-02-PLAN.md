<objective>
Add the missing Interpretation section to the Uniform Random Numbers case study MDX and verify that URN-01 and URN-02 are already satisfied by existing content.

Purpose: The canonical case study template requires a separate ## Interpretation section that synthesizes graphical and quantitative evidence. Currently the MDX goes directly from Test Summary to Conclusions. This fulfills URN-01 (verify existing), URN-02 (verify existing), and URN-04 (add Interpretation).

Output: Updated uniform-random-numbers.mdx with a complete Interpretation section following the Phase 57 pattern.

Read uniform-random-numbers.mdx and verify that URN-01 and URN-02 requirements are met:

**URN-01 verification checklist** (individual named plot subsections with per-plot interpretation):
- [ ] ### 4-Plot Overview -- exists with interpretation paragraph
- [ ] ### Run Sequence Plot -- exists with interpretation
- [ ] ### Lag Plot -- exists with interpretation
- [ ] ### Histogram -- exists with interpretation
- [ ] ### Normal Probability Plot -- exists with interpretation
- [ ] ### Uniform Probability Plot -- exists with interpretation (Distribution Focus extra)
- [ ] ### Autocorrelation Plot -- exists with interpretation
- [ ] ### Spectral Plot -- exists with interpretation

**URN-02 verification checklist** (quantitative results with full test suite):
- [ ] ### Summary Statistics -- table with n, mean, SD, median, min, max, range
- [ ] ### Location Test -- regression t-test with t = -0.66
- [ ] ### Variation Test -- Levene W = 0.07983
- [ ] ### Randomness Tests -- Runs Z = 0.269, lag-1 r1 = 0.03
- [ ] ### Distribution Test -- A-D = 5.765, Normal PPCC = 0.9772, Uniform PPCC = 0.9996
- [ ] ### Outlier Detection -- Grubbs: no outliers
- [ ] ### Test Summary -- table with all tests

If any item is missing, fix it. Based on research, all items are expected to be present.

No file changes expected from this task -- it is a verification step. If any gaps are found, fix them in this same task.

  <name>Task 2: Add Interpretation section to uniform-random-numbers.mdx</name>
  <files>src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/uniform-random-numbers.mdx</files>
  <action>
Add a `## Interpretation` section between the `### Test Summary` subsection's closing paragraph and the `## Conclusions` heading. This follows the canonical case study template and the Phase 57 established pattern.

The Interpretation section must have 3 paragraphs:

**Paragraph 1 -- Overall assessment:** Three of four assumptions pass (location, variation, randomness). The distributional assumption fails. Cite specific test statistics with InlineMath: location t = -0.66 (critical 1.96), Levene W = 0.080 (critical 2.623), Runs Z = 0.269 (critical 1.96), lag-1 r1 = 0.03 (critical 0.087). Reference the run sequence plot, lag plot, and autocorrelation plot via cross-reference links.

**Paragraph 2 -- Distributional finding:** Contrast normal rejection with uniform confirmation. Normal tests: Anderson-Darling A^2 = 5.765 far exceeds 0.787, normal PPCC = 0.9772 below 0.987 -- both decisively reject normality. Uniform tests: uniform PPCC = 0.9996 indicates excellent fit. Reference the histogram (rectangular shape vs bell shape), normal probability plot (S-shaped curvature), and uniform probability plot (nearly linear). This is the distinctive feature of this case study.

**Paragraph 3 -- Practical implications:** The sample mean (0.508) remains valid by CLT at n = 500, but the mid-range is the optimal location estimator for uniform data. The standard normal-based confidence interval overestimates uncertainty compared to distribution-specific approaches. A bootstrap or distribution-free interval should be preferred.

**Content requirements:**
- Every test statistic value must use `<InlineMath tex="..." />` (not plain text)
- Cross-reference links use the URL cross-reference format: `[technique name](/eda/techniques/slug/)` or `[test name](/eda/quantitative/slug/)`
- Use cross-reference links for: run sequence plot, lag plot, Levene test, runs test, autocorrelation, Anderson-Darling, PPCC, histogram, normal probability plot, uniform probability plot
- Heading level is `## Interpretation` (h2, same level as ## Graphical Output and ## Quantitative Output)
- Do NOT duplicate the Conclusions section content -- Interpretation synthesizes evidence; Conclusions summarizes actionable takeaways

**Reference:** Read the Normal Random Numbers case study (`src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/normal-random-numbers.mdx`) Interpretation section as a pattern example. The Uniform Random Numbers Interpretation follows the same structure but with different content (distribution fails instead of all pass).

1. `grep "^## Interpretation" src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/uniform-random-numbers.mdx` returns a match
2. `grep "InlineMath" src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/uniform-random-numbers.mdx | grep -c "Interpretation" ` confirms InlineMath usage in the Interpretation section area

4. `npx astro build` succeeds
5. Section order in MDX is: Test Summary -> Interpretation -> Conclusions (not Test Summary -> Conclusions)
