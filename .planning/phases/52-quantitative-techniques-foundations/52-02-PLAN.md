<objective>
Populate all 6 foundation MDX stubs with educational prose and create the dynamic route to render them as live pages.

Purpose: Foundation pages provide the conceptual framework (what is EDA, role of graphics, assumptions, etc.) that contextualizes the entire encyclopedia. Without these, users lack the theoretical grounding to use the technique and quantitative pages effectively.
Output: 6 populated MDX files + [...slug].astro dynamic route producing 6 live foundation pages.

Populate each of the 6 existing MDX stub files. Keep existing frontmatter (title, description, section, category, nistSection) unchanged. Replace the `{/* Content will be populated in Phase 52 */}` comment with substantive educational prose.

CONTENT FOR EACH PAGE:

1. **what-is-eda.mdx** (FOUND-01, NIST 1.1.1-1.1.4, 400+ words):
   - What is Exploratory Data Analysis and how it differs from classical/Bayesian approaches
   - The EDA philosophy: openness, skepticism of assumptions, emphasis on visualization
   - EDA vs confirmatory analysis: when to use each
   - The role of the analyst's judgment and domain knowledge
   - Cross-links: [Histogram](/eda/techniques/histogram/), [Measures of Location](/eda/quantitative/measures-of-location/), [4-Plot](/eda/techniques/4-plot/)

2. **role-of-graphics.mdx** (FOUND-02, NIST 1.1.5-1.1.6, 300+ words):

   - Cross-links: [Scatter Plot](/eda/techniques/scatter-plot/), [Box Plot](/eda/techniques/box-plot/), [Normal Probability Plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/)

3. **problem-categories.mdx** (FOUND-03, NIST 1.1.7, 300+ words):
   - The 4 problem categories: characterization, comparison, modeling, screening/DOE
   - Which EDA techniques apply to each category
   - How to select the right approach based on your question
   - Cross-links: [Two-Sample t-Test](/eda/quantitative/two-sample-t-test/), [One-Factor ANOVA](/eda/quantitative/one-factor-anova/), [DOE Plots](/eda/techniques/doe-plots/)

4. **assumptions.mdx** (FOUND-04, NIST 1.2.1-1.2.3, 400+ words):
   - The 4 standard assumptions: fixed location, fixed variation, randomness, fixed distribution
   - Why checking assumptions matters (wrong conclusions from violated assumptions)
   - How each assumption can be checked (which techniques to use)
   - Cross-links: [Run-Sequence Plot](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/), [Lag Plot](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/), [Autocorrelation](/eda/quantitative/autocorrelation/), [Runs Test](/eda/quantitative/runs-test/)

5. **the-4-plot.mdx** (FOUND-05, NIST 1.2.4, 350+ words):
   - The 4-plot as a universal first-pass diagnostic
   - What each panel shows: run sequence (location/variation stability), lag plot (randomness), histogram (distribution shape), normal probability plot (normality)
   - How to interpret the combined evidence from all 4 panels
   - Cross-links: [4-Plot](/eda/techniques/4-plot/), [6-Plot](/eda/techniques/6-plot/), [Normal Probability Plot](/eda/techniques/normal-probability-plot/)

6. **when-assumptions-fail.mdx** (FOUND-06, NIST 1.2.5, 300+ words):
   - Common assumption violations and their consequences
   - Remedial actions: transformations, robust methods, non-parametric alternatives
   - When to proceed despite violations vs when to stop and fix
   - Cross-links: [Skewness and Kurtosis](/eda/quantitative/skewness-kurtosis/), [Anderson-Darling](/eda/quantitative/anderson-darling/), [Box-Cox Normality](/eda/techniques/box-cox-normality/)

MDX FORMATTING:
- Use ## for main section headings, ### for subsections
- Use Markdown links for cross-references: `[Technique Name](/eda/category/slug/)`
- Use bullet lists and short paragraphs for readability
- Include a "Cross-References" or "Related Techniques" section at the bottom of each page
- Reference NIST section numbers in prose where relevant: "As described in Section 1.1.2..."
- Do NOT use KaTeX formulas in foundation pages (they are conceptual, not mathematical)

  <name>Task 2: Create [...slug].astro dynamic route for foundation pages</name>
  <files>src/pages/eda/foundations/[...slug].astro</files>
  <action>
Create the dynamic catch-all route for foundation pages using the edaPages collection. This route renders MDX content from the collection with the EDALayout wrapper.

Pattern:
```typescript
// src/pages/eda/foundations/[...slug].astro
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
import EDALayout from '../../../layouts/EDALayout.astro';
import EdaBreadcrumb from '../../../components/eda/EdaBreadcrumb.astro';
import BreadcrumbJsonLd from '../../../components/BreadcrumbJsonLd.astro';
```

**getStaticPaths implementation:**
1. Get all entries from edaPages collection
2. Filter by `category === 'foundations'`
3. For each entry, the collection ID will be `foundations/{slug}` (since glob base is `./src/data/eda/pages`). Strip the `foundations/` prefix to get the URL slug.
4. Return params with the stripped slug and the page entry as props.

**Template structure:**
- Use EDALayout (NOT TechniquePage -- foundations are long-form MDX content, not technique cards)
- Include EdaBreadcrumb with category="Foundations" and techniqueName={page.data.title}
- Include BreadcrumbJsonLd with crumbs: Home > EDA > Foundations > {title}
- Render MDX content via `const { Content } = await page.render(); <Content />`
- Wrap in article tag with same max-w-3xl styling as TechniquePage for visual consistency
- Add NIST section reference below the header
- Style MDX prose with Tailwind prose classes or explicit styling matching the technique pages (text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] for body text)

**MDX prose styling:**
Add a wrapping div with classes that style the MDX output:
- Headings: text-xl/text-lg font-heading font-bold
- Paragraphs: text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed
- Links: text-[var(--color-accent)] hover:underline
- Lists: list-disc/list-decimal with proper spacing
Use a `prose-foundations` class with these Tailwind styles, or apply them inline.

NOTE: Foundation pages do NOT need useKatex=true (no formulas in foundation content).
