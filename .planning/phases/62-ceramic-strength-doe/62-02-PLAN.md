<objective>
Complete the Primary Factors Analysis section with DOE-specific visualizations (mean plots, SD plots, interaction plots) and add the Interpretation section synthesizing all multi-factor evidence.

Purpose: CER-04 requires DOE-specific visualizations showing factor effects. CER-05 requires an Interpretation section synthesizing evidence from all 4 analysis sections (response variable, batch, lab, primary factors) into conclusions about which factors significantly affect ceramic strength. This plan uses the SVG generators created in Plan 01 and the restructured MDX template.

Output: Completed Primary Factors Analysis with rendered DOE visualizations, Interpretation section, and updated Conclusions

  <action>
Replace the placeholder subsections in "## Primary Factors Analysis" (created by Plan 01) with full content including DOE visualization component calls and per-plot interpretation.

**1. Update "### DOE Mean Plot" subsection:**

```mdx
### DOE Mean Plot

[DOE mean plots](/eda/techniques/doe-plots/) show the mean response at each factor level. The steeper the line connecting the two levels, the larger the effect of that factor on ceramic strength. The dashed horizontal reference line marks the batch grand mean.

#### Batch 1

<CeramicStrengthPlots type="doe-mean-batch1" />

For Batch 1, table speed (<InlineMath tex="X_1" />) produces the steepest slope, confirming its dominant effect of <InlineMath tex="-30.77" /> units. The negative sign indicates that lower table speed (level <InlineMath tex="-1" />) yields higher strength. Wheel grit (<InlineMath tex="X_3" />) shows a moderate effect of <InlineMath tex="-7.18" /> units, while down feed rate (<InlineMath tex="X_2" />) has essentially no effect (near-horizontal line).

#### Batch 2

<CeramicStrengthPlots type="doe-mean-batch2" />

For Batch 2, the pattern is markedly different. Down feed rate (<InlineMath tex="X_2" />) now produces the steepest slope with an effect of <InlineMath tex="+18.22" /> units -- the positive sign indicates that higher down feed rate yields higher strength. Wheel grit (<InlineMath tex="X_3" />) is the second most important factor at <InlineMath tex="-14.71" /> units. Table speed (<InlineMath tex="X_1" />) has essentially no effect (near-horizontal line), in stark contrast to Batch 1.
```

**2. Update "### DOE Standard Deviation Plot" subsection:**

```mdx
### DOE Standard Deviation Plot

DOE standard deviation plots show the within-level standard deviation at each factor level. Large differences between levels indicate that the factor affects not only the mean response but also its variability.

#### Batch 1

<CeramicStrengthPlots type="doe-sd-batch1" />

For Batch 1, table speed (<InlineMath tex="X_1" />) shows a substantial difference in variability between levels -- the standard deviation at the high level is approximately 20 units larger than at the low level. This variability effect is important for process optimization because it means slower table speed not only produces stronger ceramics but also more consistent ones.

#### Batch 2

<CeramicStrengthPlots type="doe-sd-batch2" />

For Batch 2, the standard deviation differences across factor levels are roughly comparable for all three factors, with no single factor dominating the variability structure. This contrasts with Batch 1 where table speed had a pronounced variability effect.
```

**3. Update "### Interaction Effects" subsection:**

```mdx
### Interaction Effects

[Interaction plots](/eda/techniques/doe-plots/) show the mean response at each level of one factor, with separate lines for each level of a second factor. Non-parallel lines indicate an interaction -- the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other.

The <InlineMath tex="X_1 \times X_3" /> (table speed by wheel grit) interaction is the most important interaction in both batches, ranked second in the effect tables for both Batch 1 (<InlineMath tex="-20.25" />) and Batch 2 (<InlineMath tex="-16.71" />).

#### Batch 1: Table Speed x Wheel Grit

<CeramicStrengthPlots type="interaction-batch1-x1x3" />

The non-parallel lines confirm the <InlineMath tex="X_1 \times X_3" /> interaction in Batch 1. At low table speed, the wheel grit effect is modest, but at high table speed, the wheel grit effect becomes much larger. The interaction magnitude of <InlineMath tex="-20.25" /> units is second only to the table speed main effect.

#### Batch 2: Table Speed x Wheel Grit

<CeramicStrengthPlots type="interaction-batch2-x1x3" />

The <InlineMath tex="X_1 \times X_3" /> interaction in Batch 2 has a similar pattern but with different magnitudes. This interaction effect of <InlineMath tex="-16.71" /> units is more important in Batch 2 (where table speed has no main effect) than in Batch 1, making it the second-ranked effect after down feed rate.
```

**4. Verify the "### Ranked Effects" subsection** (moved from Quantitative Output by Plan 01) has the existing ranked effect tables for both batches and the "Batch Comparison of Factor Effects" discussion. These should already be in place from Plan 01's restructuring. Do NOT duplicate content -- just verify it's present.

IMPORTANT: All DOE visualization content uses hardcoded NIST values (not computed in MDX). The actual plots are rendered by `<CeramicStrengthPlots>` component calls which compute means from the dataset at build time. The interpretation text references NIST-published effect magnitudes.

  <name>Task 2: Add Interpretation section and update Conclusions</name>
  <files>src/data/eda/pages/case-studies/ceramic-strength.mdx</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Add "## Interpretation" section**

Insert "## Interpretation" AFTER the "## Quantitative Output and Interpretation" section and BEFORE "## Conclusions". Follow the DOE-specific 3-paragraph synthesis pattern from the research (Example 6):

**Paragraph 1 -- Response variable screening and batch discovery:**
- Reference the [4-plot](/eda/techniques/4-plot/) screening of the pooled 480 observations
- State the [bimodal distribution](/eda/techniques/histogram/) as the dominant graphical finding
- Note that [run sequence](/eda/techniques/run-sequence-plot/) and [lag](/eda/techniques/lag-plot/) plots show no concerning temporal patterns
- Explain how the bimodality implicates a grouping factor
- Reference the [bihistogram](/eda/techniques/bihistogram/) confirming the batch source: Batch 1 centered ~689, Batch 2 centered ~611
- Reference the batch test statistics: <InlineMath tex="T = 13.38" />, <InlineMath tex="p \ll 0.001" />
- Note the batch effect of ~75-100 units is consistent across all 8 labs and all 16 treatment combinations, as confirmed by [block plots](/eda/techniques/block-plot/) and lab-specific [box plots](/eda/techniques/box-plot/)

**Paragraph 2 -- Factor decomposition and the critical finding:**
- Reference the [lab effect analysis](/eda/case-studies/ceramic-strength/) showing minor variation across labs, justifying treatment as homogeneous
- Reference [DOE mean plots](/eda/techniques/doe-plots/) revealing the factor ranking inconsistency
- State the key finding with emphasis: **the factor rankings are not consistent across batches**
- In Batch 1: table speed (<InlineMath tex="X_1" />) dominates at <InlineMath tex="-30.77" />, down feed (<InlineMath tex="X_2" />) negligible
- In Batch 2: down feed dominates at <InlineMath tex="+18.22" />, table speed negligible
- The <InlineMath tex="X_1 \times X_3" /> interaction is substantial in both batches

**Paragraph 3 -- Practical implications:**
- State the engineering consequence: no single set of optimal machining parameters applies to both batches
- Note the batch effect was completely unexpected by NIST investigators
- State the methodological lesson: graphical EDA techniques ([bihistograms](/eda/techniques/bihistogram/), [block plots](/eda/techniques/block-plot/), [DOE mean plots](/eda/techniques/doe-plots/)) efficiently reveal multi-factor structure that would be difficult to detect from summary statistics alone
- Recommend [multi-factor ANOVA](/eda/quantitative/multi-factor-anova/) with batch as a blocking factor, with primary factor effects examined separately by batch

Use definitive language throughout (per Phase 60 decision -- no hedging like "should show").

**Step 2: Update "## Conclusions" section**

The existing Conclusions section (5 numbered findings) is already well-structured and accurate. Make these targeted updates:

1. Add a reference to the new DOE visualizations in finding #1: mention that the bihistogram and block plots visually confirm the batch effect
2. Add a reference to the DOE mean plots in finding #3: mention that the DOE mean plots visually demonstrate the inconsistent factor rankings
3. In the final paragraph (recommended analysis approach), add references to the specific DOE techniques used: bihistograms, block plots, DOE mean plots, interaction plots
4. Ensure all cross-reference links are correct per the url-cross-reference cheat sheet

Do NOT rewrite the Conclusions from scratch. The existing 5 findings and their order of importance are correct. Only add references to the new visualizations.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT change any content in sections before Interpretation. All prior sections (Background, Response Variable, Batch Effect, Lab Effect, Primary Factors, Quantitative Output) should remain exactly as completed by Plan 01 and Task 1 of this plan.

<success_criteria>
The Primary Factors Analysis section has complete DOE visualizations (mean plots, SD plots, interaction plots) with per-batch sub-subsections showing the contrasting factor rankings. The Interpretation section synthesizes all multi-factor evidence into a coherent 3-paragraph narrative covering the batch discovery, the factor ranking inconsistency, and the engineering implications. The Conclusions section is updated to reference the DOE visualizations. The complete ceramic-strength.mdx follows the 8-section DOE Variation canonical template structure. The build passes with no errors.
