<objective>
Create the companion blog post "How to Choose a Database in 2026" as an MDX file that provides context for the Database Compass tool, with bidirectional cross-links to the overview and selected detail pages.

Purpose: The overview page already links to `/blog/database-compass/` (currently a 404). This blog post fills that dead link, provides SEO-rich content for search engines, and drives traffic between the blog and the tool. It also adds the 14th URL (blog post) to the sitemap.
Output: A published MDX blog post at `/blog/database-compass/` with 1500-2500 words and cross-links to 5+ model detail pages.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create companion blog post database-compass.mdx</name>
  <files>src/data/blog/database-compass.mdx</files>
  <action>
Create `src/data/blog/database-compass.mdx` with the following structure:

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
title: "How to Choose a Database in 2026"
description: "A practical framework for choosing the right database model. 12 categories scored across 8 dimensions -- scalability, performance, reliability, and more."
publishedDate: 2026-02-22
tags: ["databases", "database-compass", "cloud-native", "architecture"]
draft: false
---
```

**CRITICAL:** The filename MUST be `database-compass.mdx` (not `how-to-choose-a-database.mdx`) because the overview page already links to `/blog/database-compass/` and Astro derives the slug from the filename.

**Content structure** (target 1500-2500 words, expert voice matching existing blog posts):

1. **Introduction** (200-300 words): The database landscape has exploded -- from a handful of relational databases to 12+ distinct model categories. Frame the problem: how does a team choose when there are so many options? Introduce the Database Compass as a framework. Link to the [Database Compass overview](/tools/db-compass/).

2. **The 8 Dimensions** (400-600 words): Explain the 8 scoring dimensions briefly:
   - Operational: Scalability, Performance, Reliability, Ops Complexity
   - Developer: Query Flexibility, Schema Flexibility, Ecosystem Maturity, Learning Curve
   Each gets 2-3 sentences explaining what it measures and why it matters. Frame as "what to evaluate when choosing a database."

3. **The Complexity Spectrum** (200-300 words): Explain the key-value to multi-model spectrum concept. Simple databases are fast and focused; complex ones are flexible but harder to operate. Link to [Key-Value](/tools/db-compass/key-value/) as simplest and [Multi-Model](/tools/db-compass/multi-model/) as most complex.

4. **Five Database Models Every Architect Should Know** (500-700 words): Deep-dive into 5 representative models spanning the spectrum:
   - [Key-Value Stores](/tools/db-compass/key-value/) -- the speed champions (Redis, Memcached)
   - [Relational (SQL) Databases](/tools/db-compass/relational/) -- the proven workhorse (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
   - [Document Databases](/tools/db-compass/document/) -- schema flexibility for modern apps (MongoDB, Firestore)
   - [Graph Databases](/tools/db-compass/graph/) -- when relationships are the data (Neo4j)
   - [Vector Databases](/tools/db-compass/vector/) -- the AI era's newcomer (Pinecone, Milvus)
   Each gets a paragraph covering strengths, ideal use case, and tradeoff. Include at least one link to the detail page per model.

5. **CAP Theorem in Practice** (200-300 words): Brief explanation of CAP theorem (consistency, availability, partition tolerance) and how it affects database selection. Note that the Database Compass shows CAP classification for each model. Do NOT over-explain CAP -- this is a practical guide, not a textbook.

6. **How to Use the Database Compass** (200-300 words): Guide readers through the tool: start with the overview to see the spectrum, use the filter to narrow by use case, click into detail pages for radar charts and scoring. Link back to the [Database Compass overview](/tools/db-compass/). End with a call to action: "Explore the Database Compass to compare all 12 models across 8 dimensions."

**Writing style guidelines:**
- Match the expert, first-person voice of existing blog posts (see the-beauty-index.mdx and dockerfile-best-practices.mdx for tone)
- Use Patryk's perspective as a cloud-native architect with 17+ years of experience
- Include concrete examples and real database names
- Avoid academic tone -- this is practical advice from someone who has built systems on these databases
- Use Markdown headings (##), bold, inline code for database names, and linked references
- No MDX component imports needed -- this is a pure prose article with markdown links

Run `npx astro build`. Verify:
1. Build succeeds with zero errors
2. `dist/blog/database-compass/index.html` exists
3. `grep '/tools/db-compass/' dist/blog/database-compass/index.html | wc -l` shows 5+ cross-links
4. `grep 'database-compass' dist/sitemap-0.xml` shows the blog post URL in sitemap
5. `grep 'database-compass' dist/rss.xml` shows the blog post in RSS feed
  </verify>
  <done>Blog post published at /blog/database-compass/ with 1500-2500 words, cross-links to overview and 5+ detail pages, and proper frontmatter. The overview page's existing link to /blog/database-compass/ now resolves.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify bidirectional cross-links and sitemap completeness</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
This is a verification-only task with no file modifications. Run the build and verify the complete integration:

1. **Bidirectional links**: The overview page at `/tools/db-compass/` already has a link to `/blog/database-compass/` (from Phase 30). The blog post created in Task 1 links back to `/tools/db-compass/`. Verify both directions resolve in the built HTML.

2. **Sitemap completeness**: Count all Database Compass URLs in the sitemap. Expected: 14 URLs total (1 overview + 12 detail pages + 1 blog post). Run: `grep -c 'db-compass\|database-compass' dist/sitemap-0.xml`

3. **Blog listing**: Verify the new post appears on `/blog/` listing page. Run: `grep 'database-compass' dist/blog/index.html`

4. **OG image for blog post**: The existing blog OG image catch-all route at `src/pages/open-graph/[...slug].png.ts` should auto-generate an OG image for this blog post. Verify: `ls dist/open-graph/database-compass.png` (or similar path based on existing blog OG route pattern).

If any link is broken or URL is missing from sitemap, fix it. If all checks pass, this task is a no-op confirmation.

1. `grep '/blog/database-compass/' dist/tools/db-compass/index.html` returns a match (overview links to blog)
2. `grep '/tools/db-compass/' dist/blog/database-compass/index.html` returns 5+ matches (blog links to tool)
3. `grep -c 'db-compass\|database-compass' dist/sitemap-0.xml` returns 14+ (all URLs in sitemap)
4. Blog post appears on blog listing page
  </verify>
  <done>Bidirectional cross-links between blog post and overview page confirmed working. All 14 Database Compass URLs (1 overview + 12 detail + 1 blog) appear in the sitemap. Blog post appears in listing and RSS feed.</done>
