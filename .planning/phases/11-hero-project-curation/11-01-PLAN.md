<objective>
Update hero messaging to reflect a craft-and-precision architect identity and curate the Projects page by removing deprecated categories and projects.

Purpose: The hero tagline and roles are the first content visitors and search engines see. Removing stale projects (Full-Stack Applications category, gemini-beauty-math) keeps the portfolio focused on active, relevant work. Updating the project count in meta descriptions maintains SEO accuracy.

Output: Updated site.ts (tagline + roles), projects.ts (curated list), projects/index.astro (meta description), about.astro (highlights count). All changes propagate automatically via existing Phase 8 wiring.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update hero tagline and roles in site.ts, curate projects in projects.ts</name>
  <files>src/data/site.ts, src/data/projects.ts</files>
  <action>
In `src/data/site.ts`:
- Update `tagline` to: "Architecting resilient cloud-native systems and AI-powered platforms with 17+ years of hands-on engineering."
  This removes the location reference ("Ontario, Canada") and "Pre-1.0 Kubernetes adopter" per HERO-01. The tagline conveys craft and precision through "Architecting", "resilient", and "hands-on engineering".
- Update `roles` array to: `['Cloud-Native Architect', 'Systems Engineer', 'AI/ML Engineer', 'Platform Builder'] as const`
  CRITICAL: `roles[0]` ("Cloud-Native Architect") and `roles[2]` ("AI/ML Engineer") appear in the home page title tag via `${siteConfig.roles[0]} & ${siteConfig.roles[2]}`. These values are chosen for SEO keyword relevance. The change from "Kubernetes Pioneer" to "Systems Engineer" at index 1 broadens the identity beyond a single technology.
- Leave `name`, `jobTitle`, `description`, and `url` unchanged.

In `src/data/projects.ts`:
- Remove `'Full-Stack Applications'` from the `categories` tuple. The new tuple should be:
  `['AI/ML & LLM Agents', 'Kubernetes & Infrastructure', 'Platform & DevOps Tooling', 'Security & Networking'] as const`
- Remove the two projects with `category: 'Full-Stack Applications'` (PatrykQuantumNomad and arjancode_examples) from the `projects` array.
- Remove the gemini-beauty-math project entry from the `projects` array (it is in the 'AI/ML & LLM Agents' category).
- Remove the comment line `// Full-Stack Applications` that precedes the deleted entries.
- Final project count should be 16 (was 19, minus 3 removed).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx astro check` from the project root to confirm TypeScript types are valid (no references to removed category literal). Count projects in projects.ts to confirm exactly 16 entries remain.
  </verify>
  <done>
site.ts tagline contains no location reference and no "Pre-1.0" text. roles array has 4 entries reflecting architect/engineer/builder identity. projects.ts has no 'Full-Stack Applications' category, no gemini-beauty-math entry, and exactly 16 project entries.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update project count in meta descriptions (projects page and about page)</name>
  <files>src/pages/projects/index.astro, src/pages/about.astro</files>
  <action>
In `src/pages/projects/index.astro`:
- Update the `description` prop on line 13 from "Explore 19 open-source projects" to "Explore 16 open-source projects".
- In the same description string, remove the phrase "and full-stack applications" since that category no longer exists. The updated description should read:
  "Explore 16 open-source projects by Patryk Golabek spanning Kubernetes platforms, AI/ML agents, infrastructure as code, and security tooling."
  (Replaced "full-stack applications" with "security tooling" to reflect the remaining categories.)

In `src/pages/about.astro`:
- In the `highlights` array, update the "Open-Source Contributor" entry (currently at index 3) from "Maintaining 19+ repositories" to "Maintaining 16+ repositories".
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx astro build` from the project root. Build must complete with zero errors. Grep the built output for "19" in projects/index.html and about/index.html to confirm no stale count references remain.
  </verify>
  <done>
Projects page meta description says "16 open-source projects" and does not reference "full-stack applications". About page career highlights says "16+ repositories". Build completes successfully with zero errors.
  </done>

  <name>Task 3: Verify hero copy and project curation</name>
  <what-built>Updated hero tagline and roles in site.ts, removed 3 projects and 1 category from projects.ts, updated project counts in meta descriptions.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `npx astro dev` and open http://localhost:4321/
2. Verify the hero tagline reads: "Architecting resilient cloud-native systems and AI-powered platforms with 17+ years of hands-on engineering."
3. Watch the typing animation cycle through: Cloud-Native Architect, Systems Engineer, AI/ML Engineer, Platform Builder
4. Check the browser tab title contains "Cloud-Native Architect" and "AI/ML Engineer"
5. Navigate to http://localhost:4321/projects/
6. Confirm there is NO "Full-Stack Applications" section
7. Confirm gemini-beauty-math does NOT appear anywhere on the page
8. Confirm 4 categories are shown: AI/ML & LLM Agents, Kubernetes & Infrastructure, Platform & DevOps Tooling, Security & Networking
9. Navigate to http://localhost:4321/about/
10. Confirm the "Open-Source Contributor" highlight says "16+ repositories"

  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if the hero copy and project curation look correct, or describe any changes needed (especially to the tagline or roles wording).</resume-signal>
