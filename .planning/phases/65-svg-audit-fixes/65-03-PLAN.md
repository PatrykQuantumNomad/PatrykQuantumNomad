<objective>
Build the comprehensive SVG audit checklist (SVG-01, SVG-02 requirements), run the full Astro build to verify all 29 pages render without errors, and document the final status of every technique.

Purpose: The audit checklist is a phase success criterion and the basis for declaring NIST parity. It also catches any remaining issues introduced by Plans 01 and 02.
Output: 65-AUDIT.md with pass/fail for every technique across all audit dimensions.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Run full build and create audit checklist</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/65-svg-audit-fixes/65-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
1. **Run `npx astro build`** and capture:
   - Total build time
   - Number of pages generated
   - Any errors or warnings related to technique pages
   - Specifically look for errors mentioning technique slugs or SVG generator imports

2. **Verify all 29 technique routes exist** in build output:
   - The build output lists generated pages. Grep for `/eda/techniques/` routes.
   - Count must be 29 (one per technique slug).

3. **Create the audit checklist** at `.planning/phases/65-svg-audit-fixes/65-AUDIT.md`:

   Structure:
   ```markdown
   # Phase 65: SVG Audit Checklist

   **Audited:** {date}
   **Build status:** PASS / {N} pages generated in {time}
   **Auditor:** Claude (code review against NIST specifications)

   ## Methodology

   Each technique SVG was audited against its NIST e-Handbook source page for:
   - **Axes**: Both X and Y axes present with lines and tick marks
   - **Labels**: Axis labels match NIST conventions
   - **Grid**: Gridlines present for readability
   - **Shapes**: Visual elements match NIST (bars, stems, dots, lines, etc.)
   - **Ref Lines**: Reference lines (confidence bands, mean lines, diagonals) present where NIST shows them
   - **Scale**: Axis ranges appropriate for the data
   - **Data Pattern**: Generated dataset produces statistically correct visual pattern

   ## Legend
   - PASS: Matches NIST visual conventions
   - FIXED: Was incorrect, fixed in Phase 65
   - MINOR: Cosmetic difference, acceptable for web rendering
   - N/A: Dimension not applicable to this technique

   ## Audit Results

   | # | Technique | Slug | Renderer | Axes | Labels | Grid | Shapes | Ref Lines | Scale | Data Pattern | Status |
   |---|-----------|------|----------|------|--------|------|--------|-----------|-------|--------------|--------|
   | 1 | Histogram | histogram | direct | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | PASS |
   | 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
   ...all 29 rows...

   ## Issues Fixed in Phase 65

   | # | Issue | Severity | Fix |
   |---|-------|----------|-----|
   | 1 | Bihistogram: stacked histograms -> back-to-back | HIGH | Switched to generateBihistogram |
   | 2 | Mean Plot: bar chart -> connected dots | HIGH | Switched to generateDoeMeanPlot |
   ...
   ```

4. **For each of the 29 techniques**, read the generator code path in technique-renderer.ts and evaluate:
   - Does it call the correct generator for its NIST section?
   - Are axis labels appropriate?
   - Does the data produce the expected visual pattern?
   - Are reference lines / confidence bands present where NIST shows them?

   Populate each cell with PASS, FIXED (was wrong, fixed in 65-01/65-02), MINOR (acceptable cosmetic difference), or N/A.

5. **Document all issues fixed** in the "Issues Fixed" section referencing the plan that fixed them.

6. **If any FAIL items are found** (issues not covered by plans 01/02), document them in a "Remaining Issues" section with severity and recommended fix. Do NOT attempt to fix them in this plan -- they would be gap closure candidates.

This task is primarily analysis and documentation. The only file created is the audit checklist. No code changes.

  <verify>
- `npx astro build` completes with 0 errors
- `.planning/phases/65-svg-audit-fixes/65-AUDIT.md` exists and contains 29 rows in the audit table
- `grep -c "^|" .planning/phases/65-svg-audit-fixes/65-AUDIT.md` returns at least 31 (29 data rows + 2 header rows)
  </verify>
  <done>65-AUDIT.md exists with all 29 techniques documented. Build passes. All HIGH and MEDIUM issues from 65-RESEARCH.md are marked FIXED. No remaining FAIL items for issues within scope.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Fix any build errors or remaining issues discovered during audit</name>
  <files>src/lib/eda/technique-renderer.ts, src/lib/eda/svg-generators/*.ts</files>
  <action>
This is a contingency task. If Task 1's build or audit reveals issues:

1. **Build errors**: Fix import issues, type mismatches, or missing data in the files that changed in plans 01 and 02. Common issues:
   - Type mismatch when passing scatterData to generate6Plot (check that the function signature accepts `{x: number, y: number}[]`)
   - Missing imports in composite-plot.ts (may need linearRegression, generateScatterPlot)
   - Dead code from removed composition functions causing linter warnings

2. **Audit FAIL items**: If any technique has a clear, small fix (wrong axis label, missing title), fix it. Limit to changes that take <5 minutes each. Larger issues go in the audit's "Remaining Issues" section for gap closure.

3. **Update the audit checklist** to reflect any fixes made in this task.

If Task 1's build passes clean and audit shows no FAIL items, this task completes with "No additional fixes needed."
