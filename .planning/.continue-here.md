<current_state>
Removed all fixed height constraints from tool panels. Editor and results now expand to natural content height — page scrolls normally instead of requiring internal panel scrolling (which CodeMirror was blocking). All 3 tools updated.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phases 1-4: UX improvements (shortcuts, layout, navigation, visual polish, persistence, fullscreen)
- Removed h-[400px] lg:h-[calc(100vh-200px)] from all 3 analyzer grid columns
- Removed absolute inset-0 / overflow-hidden / h-full / flex-1 min-h-0 pattern from all 3 editor panels
- Removed flex-1 overflow-y-auto from all 3 results panels
- Removed height: 100% and overscrollBehavior from editor-theme.ts
- CodeMirror renders at natural content height, results panel renders fully

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- User visual verification of all 3 tools (Dockerfile, Compose, K8s)
- Verify analysis results render correctly after clicking Analyze
- Check mobile responsive layout still works
- Commit all changes when user approves

</remaining_work>
