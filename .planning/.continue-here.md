<current_state>
v1.7 Kubernetes Manifest Analyzer milestone started. PROJECT.md and STATE.md updated and committed. Next: define REQUIREMENTS.md, then spawn roadmapper to create ROADMAP.md with phases 41-48.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Step 1: Update PROJECT.md with Current Milestone section - Done (committed 24ec82d)
- Step 2: Update STATE.md reset for new milestone - Done (committed 24ec82d)
- Step 3: Commit milestone start - Done (24ec82d)
- Questioning: Gathered all user decisions (tool choice, scope, resource types, security depth, cross-resource validation, naming)
- Research decision: Skip research (user provided comprehensive pre-existing research on browser-based DevOps tooling)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Step 5: Define REQUIREMENTS.md - Not started (all 67 requirements already defined in plan file)
- Step 6: Commit requirements - Not started
- Step 7: Spawn gsd-roadmapper for ROADMAP.md (8 phases, 41-48) - Not started
- Step 8: Commit roadmap - Not started
- Present final "MILESTONE INITIALIZED" output with next steps
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Tool: Kubernetes Manifest Analyzer at `/tools/k8s-manifest-analyzer/`
- Multi-document YAML: `parseAllDocuments()` from yaml package for `---` separated resources
- Schema validation: K8s 1.31 standalone-strict schemas via `ajv-draft-04` (only new npm dep)
- Resource types: Extended 18 types (Deployment, Service, Pod, ConfigMap, Secret, Ingress, StatefulSet, CronJob, DaemonSet, Job, PVC, ServiceAccount, NetworkPolicy, HPA, Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding, ClusterRoleBinding)
- Security depth: Full suite (Polaris + CIS 5.2 + PSS + RBAC + NetworkPolicy + image validation)
- Cross-resource: All references + visual dependency graph (React Flow + dagre, LR layout)
- Scoring weights: Security 35%, Reliability 20%, Best Practice 20%, Schema 15%, Cross-Resource 10%
- Rule count: 67 total (8 schema + 22 security + 12 reliability + 15 best practice + 10 cross-resource)
- Rule IDs: KS-S (schema), KS-C (security), KS-R (reliability), KS-B (best practice), KS-X (cross-resource)
- URL hash prefix: `#k8s=` (distinct from `#dockerfile=` and `#compose=`)
- Content: Full pattern (rule doc pages, blog post, homepage callout, tools page, OG image, JSON-LD)
- Research: Skipped (user's pre-existing research is comprehensive)

<context>
The full milestone plan is at `~/.claude/plans/elegant-bouncing-giraffe.md` with complete requirements list, phase breakdown, file paths, and technical decisions. All 67 requirements are already written out with REQ-IDs — just need to be formatted into REQUIREMENTS.md template and committed.

The roadmapper needs to create 8 phases (41-48): Parser+Schema, Security Rules, Reliability+BestPractice Rules, Cross-Resource Rules, Editor+Results UI, Resource Graph, Rule Doc Pages+Sharing, Site Integration+Blog.

The architecture mirrors Compose Validator (v1.6) closely. Key new patterns: multi-document parsing, per-resource-type schema dispatch, container traversal utility, per-resource violation grouping in UI.

<next_action>
1. Read the plan file at `~/.claude/plans/elegant-bouncing-giraffe.md` for the full requirements list
2. Create `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` using the requirements template with all 67 requirements organized by category
3. Commit requirements
4. Resolve model profiles and spawn gsd-roadmapper with phase numbering starting at 41
5. Present roadmap for approval, commit, display "MILESTONE INITIALIZED" output
</next_action>
