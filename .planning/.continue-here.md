<current_state>
All 16 fixes from `.planning/graphical-review-remaining-fixes.md` are COMPLETE and build passes (0 errors).
Currently validating individual variant descriptions against NIST handbook source for accuracy.
Just finished validating the autocorrelation-plot "AR(1) Process" variant — it is correct.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**P1 Significant (items 7-8):**
- Item 7: Replaced non-NIST "Fan-shaped" and "Step Function" scatter-plot variants with NIST "Exact Linear" (R=1) and "Homoscedastic". Updated renderer, content examples, interpretation text.
- Item 8: Redesigned star-plot SVG generator — added `generateStarGrid()` for multi-star grid (16 auto profiles, 4x4, 6 vars). Updated index export, renderer, Python code.

**P2 Minor (items 9-16):**
- Item 9: Autocorrelation variant labels aligned to NIST ("Moderate Autocorrelation", "Sinusoidal Model")
- Item 10: Conditioning-plot — added 2 missing NIST questions
- Item 11: Scatterplot-matrix — added "Linking and Brushing" mention
- Item 12: 4-plot — switched dataset from timeSeries to beamDeflections (LEW.DAT)
- Item 13: Scatter-plot — added formulas (linear, quadratic, exponential, sinusoidal)
- Item 14: 6-plot — added model formula Y_i = f(X_i) + E_i
- Item 15: PPCC-plot — added "use judgement" and coarse-then-fine guidance
- Item 16: Autocorrelation-plot — added Bartlett widening confidence band formula

**Post-fix corrections:**
- Fixed "Moderate Autocorrelation" variant: was MA(1) description + data, changed to moderate AR (phi=0.5) with correct gradual-decay description
- Validated "AR(1) Process" variant against NIST 1.3.3.1.3 — content is accurate
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Optional: Rename "AR(1) Process" to "Strong Autocorrelation" to match NIST 1.3.3.1.3 title more closely (user was asked but session paused before response)
- Consider full validation pass of all 4 autocorrelation variants + 4 sinusoidal variants against NIST examples
- No code changes are blocking — build passes clean
- All changes are uncommitted
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Replaced "Fan-shaped" and "Step Function" with NIST variants rather than adding 2 more (kept variantCount at 12)
- "Moderate Autocorrelation" uses phi=0.5 AR data (not MA(1)) — NIST 1.3.3.1.2 describes autoregressive model with moderate positive autocorrelation
- NIST itself is inconsistent: main page (eda331.htm) links say "Weak autocorrelation" but the page title (eda3312.htm) says "Moderate Autocorrelation" — we went with "Moderate" matching the page title
- Star-plot grid uses synthetic automobile data (inspired by NIST AUTO79.DAT) with 6 variables, 16 observations in 4x4 grid
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. All work compiles and builds cleanly.

<context>
This is post-milestone (v1.10 complete) cleanup work driven by `.planning/graphical-techniques-review.md` — a comprehensive 7-agent review of all 29 graphical techniques against NIST handbook source. The review found 3 critical errors (fixed in prior session), 5 significant issues, and 8 minor items. All are now fixed.

NIST autocorrelation examples map to our variants:
1. Random (White Noise) -> "White Noise" (correct)
2. Weak/Moderate autocorrelation -> "Moderate Autocorrelation" (fixed this session)
3. Strong autocorrelation + AR model -> "AR(1) Process" (validated correct)
4. Sinusoidal model -> "Sinusoidal Model" (renamed this session)

Start with: Decide whether to rename "AR(1) Process" -> "Strong Autocorrelation" to match NIST, then commit all changes from the graphical review fixes.
