# Milestone Audit: v1.10 EDA Graphical Techniques — NIST Parity & Validation

**Audited:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** PASSED
**Scores:** Requirements 30/30 | Phases 5/5 | Integration 17/17 | E2E Flows 5/5

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Name | VERIFICATION.md | Status | Requirements |
|-------|------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| 64 | Infrastructure Foundation | Yes | PASSED (5/5 truths) | INFRA-01 through INFRA-06 (6/6) |
| 65 | SVG Audit & Fixes | Yes | PASSED (4/4 truths) | SVG-01 through SVG-04 (4/4) |
| 66 | Content Depth | Missing | All 3 SUMMARYs confirm success | QUES-01/02, IMPT-01/02, DEFN-01, CASE-01/02/03, EXMP-01/02 (10/10) |
| 67 | Technical Depth | Yes | PASSED (4/4 truths) | DEFN-02, PYTH-01 through PYTH-04 (5/5) |
| 68 | Verification & Audit | Yes | PASSED (5/5 truths) | VRFY-01 through VRFY-05 (5/5) |

## Requirements Coverage

All 30 requirements satisfied:

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Infrastructure (INFRA-01 to INFRA-06) | 6 | All satisfied |
| SVG Validation (SVG-01 to SVG-04) | 4 | All satisfied |
| Questions (QUES-01, QUES-02) | 2 | All satisfied |
| Importance (IMPT-01, IMPT-02) | 2 | All satisfied |
| Definitions (DEFN-01, DEFN-02) | 2 | All satisfied |
| Case Studies (CASE-01, CASE-02, CASE-03) | 3 | All satisfied |
| Examples (EXMP-01, EXMP-02) | 2 | All satisfied |
| Python Code (PYTH-01 to PYTH-04) | 4 | All satisfied |
| Verification (VRFY-01 to VRFY-05) | 5 | All satisfied |
| **Total** | **30** | **30/30** |

## Cross-Phase Integration

All 17 integration paths verified by gsd-integration-checker:

- Phase 64 → 66: TechniqueContent interface fields flow through to all 7 content modules
- Phase 64 → 67: KaTeX formula slot and Python code slot wired end-to-end
- Phase 65 → all: 29 SVG generators consumed via TECHNIQUE_RENDERERS map
- Phase 66 → 68: Case study cross-links validated in built HTML (26 links, all resolving)
- Phase 67 → 68: Conditional KaTeX CSS verified present on 13 formula pages, absent on 16 non-formula pages
- Barrel export chain: types.ts → 7 category modules → index.ts → [slug].astro (no broken imports)

**Orphaned export (non-blocking):** `generateBarPlot` exported but never imported — replaced by dedicated generators in Phase 65.

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Technique page with formulas (autocorrelation-plot) — all 9 sections + KaTeX + Python + cross-links | COMPLETE |
| 2 | Technique page without formulas (bihistogram) — KaTeX CSS absent, Python present | COMPLETE |
| 3 | Case study cross-link navigation (technique → case study → technique) | COMPLETE |
| 4 | Tier B variant switching (histogram — 8 variant tabs) | COMPLETE |
| 5 | Data chain: JSON → collection → getStaticPaths → 29 static pages in dist | COMPLETE |

## Build Verification

- `astro build`: 951 pages, 0 errors, 30.71s
- Lighthouse: bootstrap-plot=97, bihistogram=99, histogram=99
- Zero deprecated Python APIs across all 29 techniques
- 13/13 KaTeX formula pages rendering, 0 errors
- 26/26 case study cross-links resolving

## Tech Debt (Non-Blocking)

1. **generateBarPlot orphan** (Phase 65) — exported but unused after dedicated generators replaced it. No breakage. Low priority cleanup.
2. **Star plot / scatterplot matrix cosmetic** (Phase 65) — marked MINOR in SVG audit, not fixed. Visual only.
3. **Phase 66 missing VERIFICATION.md** — all 3 plan SUMMARYs and Phase 68 full-sweep verification cover this gap.
4. **Unused interpretation slot** (Phase 64) — TechniquePage.astro declares `<slot name="interpretation">` but it's never filled. Extension point, not a break.

## Conclusion

All requirements met. Cross-phase wiring verified. E2E flows complete. No critical gaps. Milestone v1.10 is ready to archive.
