## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- VS page enrichment uses existing justifications.ts and code-features.ts data (not AI-generated prose)
- Blog pagination gets self-referencing canonicals (NOT noindex — anti-pattern per Google docs)
- Font self-hosting uses @fontsource static packages (NOT @fontsource-variable, NOT experimental.fonts)
- CSS investigation is measurement-first: diagnose before fixing

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- VS page quality is highest risk: 650 pages must show structural variation to avoid scaled content abuse detection
- CSS investigation may close as no-op if 132KB is correct shared-chunk behavior
