# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

**Core value:** A fast, SEO-optimized, visually distinctive portfolio that ranks well in search engines and makes a memorable impression on recruiters, collaborators, and the developer community.
**Current focus:** v1.18 AI Landscape Explorer — Phase 102 (Data Foundation)

## Current Position

Phase: 102 — first of 9 phases (102-110) in v1.18
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-26 — Completed 102-01 (schema definitions, graph.json, content collection, tests)

Progress: [▓░░░░░░░░░] 3%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 231 (across 17 milestones)
- v1.18 plans completed: 1

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Research recommends build-time force pre-computation over runtime simulation (user decision pending before Phase 105)
- Content tiering strategy: research recommends full content for top ~20 concepts, noindex the rest until written
- D3 micro-module imports only (never umbrella d3 package) — bundle isolation critical
- client:only="react" for graph island (never client:visible) — prevents SSR crash
- Edge type enum: 10 categories (hierarchy, includes, enables, example, relates, progression, characterizes, aspires, applies, standardizes)
- Two-file data split: nodes.json (file() loader content collection) + graph.json (clusters/edges, direct import)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Content authoring for ~80 nodes is the longest-pole constraint — not engineering, but writing
- Build-time vs runtime simulation decision must be resolved before Phase 105 planning
- Dark mode cluster colors defined in graph.json (9 clusters with light/dark hex pairs)
- Hub page (/guides/) uses Tailwind dynamic class interpolation for accentColor — tech debt from v1.16
- Beauty Index OG image "Cannot find module renderers.mjs" error (pre-existing)
