## v1.8 Requirements

Requirements for the EDA Visual Encyclopedia milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Infrastructure

- [x] **INFRA-01**: KaTeX pipeline installed and configured (remark-math + rehype-katex) with build-time formula rendering and zero client-side JS
- [x] **INFRA-02**: KaTeX CSS and woff2 fonts self-hosted, loaded conditionally only on EDA pages that use formulas
- [x] **INFRA-03**: D3 micro-modules (d3-scale, d3-shape, d3-axis, d3-selection, d3-array, d3-path) installed and verified to load only on distribution pages via client:visible
- [x] **INFRA-04**: EDALayout.astro created extending base Layout.astro with isolated animation lifecycle (no GSAP/D3 conflicts)
- [x] **INFRA-05**: OG image caching implemented (content-hash based) to prevent build time regression with 90+ new pages
- [x] **INFRA-06**: Zod schemas defined for EdaTechnique and EdaDistribution content types in content.config.ts
- [x] **INFRA-07**: Three content collections registered: edaTechniques (JSON file() loader), edaDistributions (JSON file() loader), edaPages (MDX glob() loader)
- [x] **INFRA-08**: EDA technique page template (TechniquePage.astro) with slots for plot, formulas, Python code, interpretation, related links
- [x] **INFRA-09**: Breadcrumb component for EDA pages (EDA > Section > Technique)
- [x] **INFRA-10**: KaTeX test page validates 10+ representative NIST formula categories without build errors
- [x] **INFRA-11**: Vite bundle analysis confirms D3 modules appear only in Tier C page chunks

### Data Model

- [x] **DATA-01**: techniques.json populated with all 29 graphical technique entries
- [x] **DATA-02**: techniques.json populated with all 18 quantitative technique entries
- [x] **DATA-03**: distributions.json populated with all 19 probability distribution entries
- [x] **DATA-04**: Each technique tagged with interactivity tier (A/B/C) and variant count
- [x] **DATA-05**: MDX stub files created for 6 foundations pages with NIST section references
- [x] **DATA-06**: MDX stub files created for 9 case study pages with NIST section references
- [x] **DATA-07**: MDX stub files created for 4 reference pages
- [x] **DATA-08**: Sample datasets defined in datasets.ts for technique plot generation (NIST reference data)
- [x] **DATA-09**: All cross-linking slugs pre-populated and validated against route structure

### SVG Generators

- [x] **SVG-01** through **SVG-15**: All 15 SVG generator requirements delivered (13 generators + 2 cross-cutting: viewBox responsiveness and dark/light theme support)

### Graphical Techniques

- [x] **GRAPH-01** through **GRAPH-30**: All 30 graphical technique requirements delivered (29 technique pages + PlotVariantSwap component)
- [x] **LAND-05**: Build-time SVG thumbnails on technique cards

### Quantitative Techniques

- [x] **QUANT-01** through **QUANT-18**: All 18 quantitative technique pages with KaTeX formulas and Python code

### Foundations

- [x] **FOUND-01** through **FOUND-06**: All 6 foundation pages covering NIST sections 1.1-1.2

### Distributions

- [x] **DIST-01** through **DIST-19**: All 19 distribution pages with D3 interactive parameter explorers, static SVG fallbacks, and landing page

### Case Studies

- [x] **CASE-01** through **CASE-09**: All 9 case study walkthrough pages with NIST section references

### Reference Pages

- [x] **REF-01** through **REF-04**: All 4 reference pages with cross-links

### Landing Page

- [x] **LAND-01** through **LAND-07**: Landing page with filterable card grid, category pills, responsive layout, and SVG thumbnails

### Site Integration

- [x] **SITE-01** through **SITE-13**: Full site integration (header nav, homepage callout, JSON-LD, SEO meta, sitemap, LLMs.txt, OG images, blog post, cross-links, Lighthouse 90+, WCAG 2.1 AA, NIST citations, Python code with copy buttons)

### Content Quality

- [x] **QUAL-01** through **QUAL-04**: Formula verification, 200+ word prose, runnable Python, functional cross-links

| INFRA-01 to INFRA-11 | Phase 48 | Complete |
| DATA-01 to DATA-09 | Phase 49 | Complete |
| SVG-01 to SVG-15 | Phase 50 | Complete |
| GRAPH-01 to GRAPH-30, LAND-05 | Phase 51 | Complete |
| QUANT-01 to QUANT-18, FOUND-01 to FOUND-06, SITE-13 | Phase 52 | Complete |
| DIST-01 to DIST-19 | Phase 53 | Complete |
| CASE-01 to CASE-09, REF-01 to REF-04, LAND-01 to LAND-04, LAND-06 to LAND-07 | Phase 54 | Complete |

**Coverage:**
- v1.8 requirements: 145 total (12 categories)
- Shipped: 145 of 145
- Adjusted: 1 (DATA-01 corrected from 30 to 29 graphical entries; GRAPH-30 is component, not data)
- Dropped: 0

**Note:** DIST-16 duplicates DIST-05 (both Lognormal distribution). Both mapped to Phase 53 and delivered as a single page.
