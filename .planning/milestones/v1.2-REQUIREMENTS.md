## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for the Projects Page Redesign milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Data Model

- [x] **DATA-01**: Project data includes `technologies` array for multi-tech badge display
- [x] **DATA-02**: Project data includes `featured` flag to spotlight hero projects
- [x] **DATA-03**: Project data includes `status` field (active/archived/experimental)
- [x] **DATA-04**: Project data includes `gridSize` hint for bento layout placement (large/medium/small)

### Layout

- [x] **LAYOUT-01**: Projects page uses bento grid with asymmetric card sizes based on gridSize
- [x] **LAYOUT-02**: Featured project(s) display in a hero section above the category grid
- [x] **LAYOUT-03**: Categories separated by animated gradient dividers
- [x] **LAYOUT-04**: Responsive layout — bento on desktop, 2-col on tablet, 1-col stacked on mobile

### Filtering

- [x] **FILTER-01**: Category filter tabs at top of page with "All" default
- [x] **FILTER-02**: Clicking filter tab shows/hides cards with smooth GSAP Flip transitions
- [x] **FILTER-03**: Active filter state visually indicated (accent styling on active tab with aria-pressed)
- [x] **FILTER-04**: Filter state reflected in URL hash for shareability (#ai-ml, #kubernetes, etc.)

### Animations

- [x] **ANIM-01**: Cards stagger-reveal on scroll with GSAP (using existing `data-card-group` infrastructure)
- [x] **ANIM-02**: Mouse-tracking gradient glow follows cursor across card surface
- [x] **ANIM-03**: Floating section orbs behind category groups (using existing `data-section-bg`)
- [x] **ANIM-04**: Magnetic effect on card CTA buttons (using existing `data-magnetic`)
- [x] **ANIM-05**: Filter tab transitions animate card layout changes (GSAP Flip with stagger)
- [x] **ANIM-06**: All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` with graceful fallbacks

### Visual Design

- [x] **VIS-01**: Tech stack badges displayed as pills on each project card
- [x] **VIS-02**: Project status badges (Featured/Active/Live) with distinct styling and dot indicators
- [x] **VIS-03**: Category filter tabs styled as pill buttons with hover and aria-pressed active states
- [x] **VIS-04**: Cards use enhanced glassmorphism with category-tinted glow on hover
- [x] **VIS-05**: Category headers include project count in mono metadata style

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

- **DATA-05**: Project screenshots/images for visual card previews
- **DATA-06**: GitHub API integration for star counts and last-commit dates
- **FILTER-05**: Search bar with real-time text filtering across project name/description/tech
- **LAYOUT-05**: Project detail modal or drawer with full README preview
- **LAYOUT-06**: Dedicated project detail pages at `/projects/[slug]/`

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| GitHub API runtime calls | Static site — would need build-time fetch or external service |
| Project screenshots | Requires creating/hosting 16 images; defer to v2 |
| Sort options (date, popularity) | No date/popularity data available; defer until GitHub API |
| Contact form on project cards | Already out of scope from v1.0 |
| Comments/ratings on projects | Portfolio, not social platform |
| Server-side filtering | Static site — all filtering is client-side JS |
