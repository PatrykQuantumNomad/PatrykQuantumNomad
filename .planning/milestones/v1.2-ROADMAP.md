# Milestone v1.2: Projects Page Redesign

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-13
**Phases:** 13-15
**Total Plans:** 6

## Overview

Transformed the projects page from a basic 3-column grid into a visually striking, interactive bento-grid showcase with category filtering, rich animations, and enhanced project data — a portfolio page that demonstrates frontend craft.

## Phases

### Phase 13: Data Model & Bento Grid Layout

**Goal**: Projects page renders all 16 projects in an asymmetric bento grid with featured hero section and responsive breakpoints
**Depends on**: Phase 12 (existing projects.ts data and page)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 13-01: Extend Project data model with technologies, featured, status, gridSize
- [x] 13-02: Rebuild projects page with hero section and bento grid layout

**Details:**
- Extended Project interface with 4 new fields (technologies, featured, status, gridSize)
- Populated all 16 project entries with accurate data: 2 featured, 3 large / 8 medium / 5 small
- Created ProjectCard.astro with gridSize-driven column spanning
- Created ProjectHero.astro for featured project showcase
- Rebuilt projects page: hero section above 4 category bento grids with gradient dividers
- Responsive 4-col/2-col/1-col breakpoints with grid-flow-dense

### Phase 14: Visual Design & Card Components

**Goal**: Project cards are visually rich with tech badges, status indicators, glassmorphism effects, and polished category headers
**Depends on**: Phase 13 (bento grid structure and data model)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 14-01: CSS category glow system and enhanced card components (tech pills, status badges, category glow)
- [x] 14-02: Category headers with monospace project count metadata

**Details:**
- Category-tinted glassmorphism glow on hover (violet/AI, blue/K8s, emerald/Platform, amber/Security)
- Styled tech pills with bg-surface-alt background tint
- Status badges with colored dot indicators (emerald/active, amber/experimental, gray/archived)
- Featured badge with accent dot, Live badge with pulsing sky-blue dot
- Category headers show project count in meta-mono style ("AI/ML & LLM Agents // 7 projects")

### Phase 15: Filtering, Animations & Polish

**Goal**: Users can filter projects by category with smooth transitions, and all page elements use rich scroll-triggered and interactive animations with accessibility fallbacks
**Depends on**: Phase 14 (complete visual card design)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 15-01: Category filter system with GSAP Flip transitions and URL hash sync
- [x] 15-02: Mouse-tracking glow, floating orbs, and magnetic CTA buttons

**Details:**
- ProjectFilterBar with 5 pill buttons (All + 4 categories) using aria-pressed state
- GSAP Flip.from() animated layout transitions with staggered card enter/leave
- URL hash sync (#ai-ml, #kubernetes, etc.) with replaceState
- vanilla-tilt lifecycle management (destroy before Flip, reinit in onComplete)
- Mouse-tracking radial gradient glow following cursor across card surfaces
- Category-tinted floating parallax orbs behind all 4 category sections
- Magnetic pull on CTA buttons via data-magnetic attribute
- All effects disabled for reduced-motion and touch devices

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Inline style --category-glow over data-attribute CSS selectors (simpler, fewer rules)
- Button elements for filter tabs (not anchors) to prevent Astro ClientRouter interception
- replaceState for hash updates (not pushState) to avoid polluting browser history
- vanilla-tilt destroy before Flip.getState, reinit via dynamic import in onComplete
- grid-flow-dense on category grids to fill gaps from 2-col spanning cards
- ProjectCard uses conditional rendering (div vs anchor) based on liveUrl presence

**Issues Resolved:**
- Missing position: relative on .card-hover class (required for ::after glow overlay)

**Issues Deferred:**
- LinkedIn removal from JSON-LD sameAs (CONFIG-02, deferred since v1.1)
- No shared getBlogPostUrl helper — URL resolution duplicated in 3 files
- Social links hardcoded across 5 component files instead of centralized config

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Filter system uses inline script (~80 lines) in projects/index.astro — could be extracted to standalone module
- Category colors defined in 3 places (ProjectCard, ProjectHero, FloatingOrbs) — could be centralized config
