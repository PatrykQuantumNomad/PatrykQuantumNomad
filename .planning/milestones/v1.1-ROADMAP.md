# Milestone v1.1: Content Refresh

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-12
**Phases:** 8-12
**Total Plans:** 7

## Overview

Update personal info, refine hero messaging, curate projects, and integrate external blog content from Kubert AI and Translucent Computing.

## Phases

### Phase 8: Schema & Hero Config Foundation
**Goal**: Data contracts exist so that all subsequent content changes propagate consistently
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.1 -- builds on shipped v1.0)
**Requirements**: BLOG-07, HERO-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Blog content schema accepts optional `externalUrl` and `source` fields without breaking existing posts
  2. A centralized hero config in `src/data/site.ts` exports name, tagline, and roles array
  3. Home page title tag, meta description, and JSON-LD Person entity consume hero data from site.ts (not hardcoded strings)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Create site.ts hero config and extend blog schema with externalUrl/source
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — Wire home page and PersonJsonLd to consume from site.ts

### Phase 9: External Blog Integration
**Goal**: Visitors see a credible content hub with 8-12 curated external posts from Kubert AI and Translucent Computing alongside local blog content
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (schema must support externalUrl and source fields)
**Requirements**: BLOG-01, BLOG-02, BLOG-03, BLOG-04, BLOG-05, BLOG-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Blog listing page displays external posts mixed with local posts, sorted chronologically by date
  2. External blog entries show a visible source badge (e.g., "on Kubert AI") and an external link icon distinguishing them from local posts
  3. Clicking an external blog entry opens the external site in a new tab (not an internal page)
  4. No `/blog/ext-*` detail pages exist in the built output -- external posts do not generate slug pages or OG images
  5. RSS feed at `/rss.xml` includes external blog entries with their canonical external URL as the link
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — Create external blog content files and add getStaticPaths guards
- [x] 09-02-PLAN.md — Update BlogCard for external links with source badges and update RSS feed

### Phase 10: Social Links & Contact Update
**Goal**: All visible social links and contact info reflect current accounts (X, YouTube, updated email) with LinkedIn removed from the UI
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phases 8-9 -- updates component files directly)
**Requirements**: SOCIAL-01, SOCIAL-02, SOCIAL-03, SOCIAL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Footer, Contact page, and Home CTA all display pgolabek@gmail.com as the email address
  2. X (@QuantumMentat) link appears in Footer and Contact with proper SVG icon and aria-label
  3. YouTube (@QuantumMentat) link appears in Footer and Contact with proper SVG icon and aria-label
  4. LinkedIn link is no longer visible anywhere in the site UI (Footer, Contact, Home CTA)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — Update social links (X, YouTube), email, and PersonJsonLd across all 5 files

### Phase 11: Hero & Project Curation
**Goal**: Hero section conveys a craft-and-precision architect identity, and the Projects page shows only active, relevant work
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (hero config in site.ts must exist for keyword propagation)
**Requirements**: HERO-01, HERO-02, PROJ-01, PROJ-02, PROJ-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Hero section displays a new tagline with craft and precision tone -- no location reference, no "Pre-1.0 Kubernetes adopter"
  2. Hero typing animation cycles through updated roles reflecting architect/engineer/builder identity
  3. Projects page no longer shows the "Full-Stack Applications" category or gemini-beauty-math
  4. Project count in meta descriptions matches the actual number of displayed projects
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — Update hero tagline/roles in site.ts, curate projects, update meta description counts

### Phase 12: Cleanup & Verification
**Goal**: All stale content is removed and every generated output (sitemap, RSS, LLMs.txt, OG images) accurately reflects the v1.1 content changes
**Depends on**: Phases 8, 9, 10, 11 (verification must happen after all content changes)
**Requirements**: CLEAN-01, CLEAN-02, CLEAN-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The draft placeholder blog post file is deleted and does not appear in any build output
  2. `astro build` completes with zero errors and no broken internal links
  3. Sitemap lists all valid pages (no removed pages, includes new tag pages if any)
  4. RSS feed entries have correct links -- external posts link externally, local posts link to `/blog/[slug]/`
  5. LLMs.txt reflects updated content accurately
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 12-01-PLAN.md — Delete draft placeholder, fix external URL bugs in LLMs.txt and homepage, verify all build outputs

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- "Core only" for social links: update directly in component files, no centralized site.ts for social
- Single-collection approach for external blog posts (schema extension, not separate data source)
- LinkedIn removed from UI but retained in JSON-LD sameAs for SEO (deferred full removal to v1.2)
- Used `as const` for siteConfig to preserve literal types for downstream consumers
- Frontmatter-only stubs with no body content for external blog posts
- getStaticPaths guards exclude external posts in both dev and prod modes
- Nullish coalescing pattern for URL resolution (externalUrl ?? internal path)

**Issues Resolved:**
- External blog posts linking to non-existent /blog/ext-*/ pages in LLMs.txt and homepage (fixed in Phase 12)
- Hero tagline messaging refined from location-based to craft-and-precision tone

**Issues Deferred:**
- CONFIG-01: Centralized site.ts for social links (deferred to v1.2)
- CONFIG-02: LinkedIn removal from JSON-LD sameAs (deferred to v1.2)
- Pre-existing `astro check` Buffer type error in [...slug].png.ts (predates v1.1)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- No shared `getBlogPostUrl` helper — URL resolution duplicated in 3 files (rss.xml.ts, llms.txt.ts, index.astro)
- Social links hardcoded across 5 component files instead of centralized config
