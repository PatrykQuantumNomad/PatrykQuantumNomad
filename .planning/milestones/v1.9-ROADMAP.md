# Milestone v1.9: EDA Case Study Deep Dive

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-27
**Phases:** 56-63
**Total Plans:** 19

## Overview

Enhanced all 9 EDA case studies to full NIST/SEMATECH source depth with individual named plot subsections, detailed quantitative test batteries, interpretation sections, and develop/validate model sections. Added Standard Resistor as a new case study. Created 4 new DOE-specific SVG generators. Validated all content with zero broken links, clean 951-page build, and NIST-verified statistical values.

## Phases

### Phase 56: Infrastructure Foundation

**Goal**: All shared infrastructure is in place so every content phase can focus purely on content writing and verification

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

**Details:**
Built runs test, Bartlett test, Levene test, Anderson-Darling, Grubbs test, PPCC, and location regression t-test with Cornish-Fisher tQuantile. PlotFigure.astro wrapper extracted from existing Plots components. Canonical case study template defined with 4 variations. URL cross-reference cheat sheet created.

### Phase 57: Minor-Gap Case Studies

**Goal**: Four nearly-complete case studies reach full NIST parity with computed quantitative results, individual plot subsections, and interpretation sections
**Depends on**: Phase 56
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 57-01: Add Interpretation sections to Normal Random Numbers and Heat Flow Meter, verify NIST values, resolve HFM PPCC discrepancy
- [x] 57-02: Fix Cryothermometry heading structure to canonical format and add Interpretation section
- [x] 57-03: Restructure Filter Transmittance with canonical headings, add missing Histogram/Probability Plot subsections, add Interpretation section

**Details:**
Established 3-paragraph Interpretation pattern. Corrected HFM PPCC from 0.996 to 0.999. Fixed Filter Transmittance r1 to 0.94. Added autocorrelation caveat pattern for subsections when randomness fails.

### Phase 58: Standard Resistor Case Study

**Goal**: A complete new case study for NIST Section 1.4.2.7 (Standard Resistor) exists with the same depth and structure as the enhanced Phase 57 studies
**Depends on**: Phase 57
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 58-01: Dataset array (1000 values) + StandardResistorPlots.astro + CaseStudyDataset registration
- [x] 58-02: Full MDX page with all sections, NIST-verified statistics, and cross-references

**Details:**
Created DZIUBA1.DAT dataset (1000 observations), StandardResistorPlots.astro with 7 plot types, complete MDX page following three-violation case study pattern. Registered in navigation and CaseStudyDataset mapping.

### Phase 59: Uniform Random Numbers Enhancement

**Goal**: Uniform Random Numbers case study reaches full NIST parity including the uniform PDF overlay that distinguishes it from the standard-pattern studies
**Depends on**: Phase 56
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 59-01: Uniform PDF overlay option in histogram generator + UniformRandomPlots update
- [x] 59-02: Interpretation section content + URN-01/URN-02 verification

**Details:**
Added showUniformPDF option to histogram generator with dashed horizontal line overlay. Computed expected frequency as n * binWidth / rangeWidth. Interpretation contrasts normal rejection with uniform confirmation.

### Phase 60: Beam Deflections Deep Dive

**Goal**: Beam Deflections case study includes full model development and validation workflow matching NIST depth, with sinusoidal model fitting and complete residual diagnostics
**Depends on**: Phase 56
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 60-01: Add residual-spectral plot type and per-plot interpretation for all 7 residual subsections
- [x] 60-02: Expand Develop Better Model with NIST regression parameters and residual SD comparison
- [x] 60-03: Validation Summary table, Interpretation section, and Conclusions update

**Details:**
Added residual spectral plot type. NIST regression parameters (C, AMP, FREQ, PHASE) with standard errors. Residual SD comparison (155.85 vs 277.33). Validation Summary table comparing original vs residual assumptions.

### Phase 61: Fatigue Life Deep Dive

**Goal**: Fatigue Life case study includes distribution fitting analysis with Weibull and gamma probability plots matching NIST depth
**Depends on**: Phase 56
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 61-01: Restructure MDX to canonical Distribution Focus Variation template with named plot subsections
- [x] 61-02: Gamma probability plot engineering, Weibull/gamma distribution comparison plots, and full quantitative test battery
- [x] 61-03: Interpretation section synthesizing distribution selection evidence and Conclusions update

**Details:**
Implemented gammaQuantile via bisection on lowerIncompleteGammaRatio. Added gamma probability plot type. Distribution comparison with AIC/BIC model selection. Interpretation acknowledges mixed results (location marginal rejection, runs test rejection attributed to skewness clustering).

### Phase 62: Ceramic Strength DOE

**Goal**: Ceramic Strength case study includes full multi-factor DOE analysis with batch effects, lab effects, and primary factors analysis matching the unique NIST 6-section structure
**Depends on**: Phase 56
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 62-01: DOE SVG generators (bihistogram, DOE mean, block plot, interaction), MDX restructure to DOE template, Batch/Lab effect subsections
- [x] 62-02: Primary Factors DOE visualizations, Interpretation section, and Conclusions update

**Details:**
Created 4 new DOE-specific SVG generators. Lab ANOVA F=1.837 < Fcrit=2.082 confirms homogeneity. DOE Variation template with 6 H2 sections. Interaction Effects focuses on X1*X3 (ranked 2nd in both batches).

### Phase 63: Validation

**Goal**: All 9 enhanced case studies are verified for link integrity, build correctness, and statistical accuracy
**Depends on**: Phase 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62
**Plans**: 2 plans

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Cornish-Fisher tQuantile without df-threshold for accuracy across all df values
- Lag-4 (k=4) for Bartlett/Levene group splits matching NIST convention
- 3-paragraph Interpretation pattern (assessment, finding, implications) across all case studies
- Hardcode NIST regression parameters to avoid nonlinear least squares solver
- DOE Variation template with 6 H2 sections for multi-factor analysis
- Bisection-based gammaQuantile for guaranteed convergence
- Definitive interpretation language replacing hedging

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed HFM PPCC value (0.996 → 0.999) matching NIST source
- Fixed Filter Transmittance r1 (computed 0.9380, rounded to 0.94)
- Fixed 4 broken cross-reference links in ceramic-strength.mdx (batch-block-plot → block-plot)
- Resolved all 9 case study statistical discrepancies against NIST source data

**Issues Deferred:**
- User data upload for all EDA techniques (deferred to v2+; 4-Plot tool covers valuable use case)
- Interactive parameter fitting on case study pages (deferred to v2+)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None identified — all case studies follow canonical templates and validated against NIST sources
