- **CONFIG-02**: LinkedIn retained in JSON-LD sameAs array for SEO entity recognition

### Blog Enhancements

- **BLOG-09**: About page cross-promotes external blog content

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Google Analytics / Plausible | 45KB+ script, requires cookie consent — evaluate in dedicated milestone |
| CMS integration | Adding a CMS for 3-5 stub files is overkill — content managed as Markdown |
| Tailwind v4 upgrade | Save for infrastructure milestone — v3.4.19 works fine |
| RSS feed loader (astro-loader-rss) | Adds build-time network dependency for quarterly publishing cadence |
| Icon library (astro-icon) | 2 new SVG icons do not justify a dependency |
| Blog source filtering tabs | Not enough posts to warrant — defer to v1.2+ |
| Comments system | Requires moderation infrastructure — out of scope |
