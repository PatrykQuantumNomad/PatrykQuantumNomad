# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **GitHub profile repository** (github.com/PatrykQuantumNomad). It contains a single `README.md` that serves as the public-facing profile page on GitHub.

## Goal

Improve the **SEO and public visibility** of the PatrykQuantumNomad GitHub account. This is Patryk Golabek's personal GitHub profile — the README is a key asset for professional discoverability by recruiters, collaborators, and the developer community.

## Owner Profile

- **Name:** Patryk Golabek
- **Title:** Cloud-Native Software Architect (17+ years)
- **Location:** Ontario, Canada
- **Specialties:** Kubernetes (pre-1.0 adopter), AI/ML systems, DevSecOps, platform engineering
- **Blogs:** [Translucent Computing](https://translucentcomputing.com/blog/), [Kubert AI](https://mykubert.com/blog/)
- **Target roles:** Software Architect, Staff Engineer, Engineering Leadership

## Structure

- `README.md` — Profile page with bio, tech stack, featured projects, and writing links

## SEO & Visibility Strategy

When editing this repository, keep these priorities in mind:

- **Keyword-rich content:** Naturally incorporate searchable terms (e.g., "Kubernetes architect", "cloud-native", "AI/ML engineer", "platform engineering") — GitHub profile READMEs are indexed by search engines
- **Backlinks:** Link to blogs, projects, and external profiles (LinkedIn, dev.to, etc.) to strengthen cross-platform discoverability
- **Featured projects:** Highlight repos with clear descriptions, pinned repos should have strong README files of their own
- **Activity signals:** GitHub rewards active profiles — contributions, repos, and commit history all matter
- **Social proof:** Certifications, speaking engagements, blog posts, and open-source contributions build credibility
- **Structured formatting:** Use headings, bold text, and tables — search engines parse these for relevance signals

## Editing Guidelines

- The README uses GitHub-flavored Markdown and renders as the profile landing page
- Featured projects link to other repositories under the PatrykQuantumNomad GitHub account
- Keep formatting compatible with GitHub's profile README rendering (tables, badges, links, images)
- Tone should be professional but approachable — first person, concise, confident
- Avoid walls of text; use scannable sections with clear hierarchy
