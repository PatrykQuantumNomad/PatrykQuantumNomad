# Patryk Golabek — Software Architect

**Software Architect | 17+ Years Building Scalable Systems**

I've been writing code, building things, and leading teams for over 17 years, and *I still get excited about it*.
From backend services to frontend apps, cloud infrastructure to ML pipelines, data science to the occasional hardware project.
I love jumping across disciplines and picking up whatever tools the problem calls for.
The best part of this career is that there's always something new to learn.
